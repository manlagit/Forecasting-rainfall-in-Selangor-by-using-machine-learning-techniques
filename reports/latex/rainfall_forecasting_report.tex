\section{Research Background}
\label{sec:research_background}
Rainfall patterns in Selangor region of Malaysia fluctuate widely partially driven by the tropical climate. In Selangor precipitation patterns are significantly influenced by tropical climate with the heaviest rainfall happening between October and December. November is the peak of this season where 324 mm of rainfall is experienced across 28 days. In October 222 mm of rainfall is experienced while in December 246 mm of rainfall is experienced. At the beginning of the year the amount of rainfall is relatively lower. January and February receive 148 mm and 102 mm respectively. However, April receives a rainfall of 241 mm which is comparable to precipitation received in peak season. During the summer months of June and July relatively lower rainfall amounts of 145 mm and 135 mm respectively are received (Nomadseason, 2025). These seasonal patterns have a major influence on local ecosystems as well as agriculture activities and water management. The Malaysian Meteorological Department (2025) analysed annual rainfall data from 1951 to 2023 and found there has been an upward trend in the amount of rainfall received in the country. This points to climate change that can lead to higher temperatures, rising sea levels, often occurrence of extreme events such as floods, disruption of habitats and agricultural activities, and economic losses. These fluctuations make it difficult to accurately forecast climate patterns. Climatic events such as frequent and heavy rainfall can lead to crop failure, floods, and water contamination. Similarly, seasons such as the monsoon have a significant influence on rainfall and its distribution. The Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia (2025) describes monsoon rains as “typically of long duration with intermittent heavy bursts and the intensity can occasionally exceed several hundred mm in 24 hours”. This can lead to floods in urban areas and disruption of agricultural activities. Accurate forecasting will help the Selangor State Government in mitigating the effects of these events. Equipped with accurate forecasts the state government can put in place well planned emergency as well as disaster and preparedness strategies.

Machine learning models have become a critical tool in analysis of meteorological data. When comparing machine learning models with conventional Numerical Weather Prediction models, it has been observed machine learning models are superior at detecting intricate numerical and non-linear patterns in data (Bouallègue et al., 2024). This makes machine learning a suitable approach for predicting rainfall in a tropical region like Selangor. Large amounts of meteorological data can be analysed using machine learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to provide accurate temporal estimations. These methods that will be discussed later, use historical data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall to provide accurate forecasts which were hitherto impossible using traditional techniques such as linear regression.

The problem is critical in places such as Selangor, where rainy conditions have not been accurately forecasting posing several difficulties. Hydrological functions enhanced by better rainfall predictions enable timely decisions in crop production, disaster management including floods and landslides, and water management. Due to improved accuracy levels of predictions, stakeholders will be in a position to save structures from destruction, people from hunger as well as resources from wastage.

Recent advances in machine learning have expanded possibilities for improving rainfall forecasting. Machine learning methods like support vector machines, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks have shown great potential in capturing both temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall. These models are able to improve forecasts by continuously learning from new data. In Selangor, using machine learning techniques and local meteorological data presents an opportunity to develop a forecasting system that is highly accurate.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}
Climate change has received significant global attention due to disastrous events it can cause. Rainfall is a major meteorological factor that is influenced by climate change. In Malaysia, rainfall patterns have changed causing floods and droughts. Selangor is one the states that has been affected by these changes in rainfall patterns. Disastrous floods happened consecutively in the years 2006 to 2008 and in the years 2010 and 2011. The years 1997, 1998, and 2008 had catastrophic dry periods (Talib et al., 2024). Agricultural decisions and productivity are significantly influenced by environmental variables particularly the amount of water available and rainfall. In Selangor the influence of these variables is significant and a threat to agricultural productivity. High and low rainfall affects crops. Although it is possible to mitigate low rainfall through irrigation, high rainfall usually damages crops and results in low agricultural productivity. Mitigation measures such as changing crop cycles and combining crop cycles have not been adequate. To adequately solve these problems technological solutions are required (Alam, 2021).

One of the technological solutions that can be used is availing accurate rainfall predictions. However, due to irregular occurrence of rainfall in Timur Region Selangor accurate prediction is difficult. This situation can harm farming, cause floods, and cause difficulties in water resources planning. Traditional models such as linear regression may not provide accurate precipitation forecast especially in the tropics because the atmospheric behaviour is not easy to predict. For example, Kassem et al. (2021) reported artificial neural networks were superior to linear regression in predicting monthly rainfall in Northern Cyprus. That study showed artificial neural networks were better at capturing relationships in coordinates, meteorological variables, and rainfall resulting in more accurate prediction compared to linear regression. Traditional models such as linear regression are weak at capturing complex relationships especially when they are non-linear. Compared to models such as support vector machines and artificial neural networks, linear regression models are poor at handling non-linear relationships. Conversely, support vector machines and artificial neural networks are difficult to interpret, computationally costly, and require large amounts of data (Goodfellow et al., 2023; Murphy, 2022). Modern meteorological research does not face the limitations of small datasets and limited computational power that were prevalent several decades ago. Meteorological instruments and IoT sensors have enabled accumulation of large datasets. This situation enables use of advanced machine learning models such as support vector machines and artificial neural networks in predicting rainfall. Specifically, in Selangor large volumes of meteorological data are available. Therefore, these advanced machine learning models can be used to accurate predict rainfall patterns. Insights obtained will be useful in agricultural, infrastructure, public health, and water management planning.

\end{itemize}

\section{Research Scopes}
\label{sec:research_scopes}
This research deals with rainfall prediction for Selangor, Malaysia where the rainfall has irregular tropical pattern and significantly affects sectors such as water supply and flood control, agriculture. These problems will be addressed in this work by utilising and comparing a number of machine learning algorithms with support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks (ANN). These methods were chosen due to the possibility of the interpretation of which dependencies – both linear and nonlinear ones – are present in the data. In the present study, meteorological data from Sepang/KL International Airport is employed for data analysis where necessary climatic factors embracing average temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and precipitation for the years between 2012 and 2020 are utilised. This is to make certain that the data collected are accurate and reliable to increase the efficiency of data analysis after it has been fed into the system therefore data cleaning, normalization of data, handling of missing values and feature engineering will be undertaken. To fully assess predictive performance, the model will be evaluated using measures like the Coefficient of Determination (R\textsuperscript{2}), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

\section{Significance of Study}

The research focus on using machine learning for rainfall forecasting in Selangor. Machine learning techniques utilize historical data to identify complex relationships, resulting in more precise and current forecasts. This study improves the scientific understanding of based on rainfall forecasting by evaluating how well different machine learning algorithms capture detailed tropical rainfall patterns. It represents a major breakthrough in environmental prediction and building resilience since it expands the use of machine learning for tropical weather forecasting and offers a structure that can be adjusted for different climates. The forecasting results could help the government in enhancing disaster readiness.

\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}

This chapter explain detailed methodology used for forecasting rainfall in Selangor using machine learning techniques. The process involve data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation and evaluation framework.

    \label{fig:3_1_data_science_methodology}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:3_1_data_science_methodology}:}
This figure provides a high-level overview of the research process. It confirms the structured approach followed, ensuring all steps align with the objectives. The flowchart format aids readability and should be referenced to emphasize methodological rigor.

\section{Data Acquisition and Integration}
\label{sec:data_acquisition}

The dataset for this study was obtained from official weather station records in Selangor, Malaysia. Two CSV files were used for this research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{230731665812CCD\_weekly1.csv}: Contains 470 records of weekly weather data from 2012-2021
    \item \texttt{230731450378CCD\_weekly2.csv}: Validation duplicate used for data integrity checking
\end{itemize}

Data loading was implemented with robust error handling and validation checks to ensure data integrity. The dataset contains following features:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Dataset Features}
\label{tab:dataset_features}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Unit} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Date & YYYY-MM-DD & Date of record \\
\hline
Precipitation\_mm & mm & Weekly precipitation amount (target variable) \\
\hline
Temp\_avg & °C & Average weekly temperature \\
\hline
Relative\_Humidity & \% & Average weekly relative humidity \\
\hline
Wind\_kmh & km/h & Average weekly wind speed \\
\hline
Week\_Number & 1-52 & Week number in year \\
\hline
Year & YYYY & Year of record \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To ensure data reliability, duplicate detection was performed when merging the two CSV files. This approach is cost-efficient as it use existing datasets without need for external API calls.

\section{Data Preprocessing Pipeline}
\label{sec:data_preprocessing}

A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline was implemented to prepare the data for model training. This pipeline include data cleaning, feature engineering, normalization, and data splitting.

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
\label{subsec:data_cleaning}

\subsubsection{Missing Value Handling}
\label{subsubsec:missing_values}

Missing values were handled using mean imputation with \texttt{pandas.fillna()} method. Validation checks were performed before and after imputation to ensure data integrity. All operations were logged for traceability. The proportion of missing values was low ($<2\%$), making mean imputation a suitable approach.

\subsubsection{Outlier Detection and Removal}
\label{subsubsec:outlier_detection}

An Interquartile Range (IQR) based method was employed to detect and remove outliers. This non-parametric approach is robust to non-normal distributions and less sensitive to extreme values than standard deviation-based methods. The following acceptable ranges were established based on domain knowledge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Temperature: 20-35°C
    \item Humidity: 0-100\%
    \item Wind speed: 0-15 km/h
    \item Precipitation: 0-400mm
\end{itemize}

The IQR method was implemented as follows:

\begin{equation}
Q_1 = \text{25th percentile}, \quad Q_3 = \text{75th percentile}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Lower bound} = Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR, \quad \text{Upper bound} = Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR
\end{equation}

Values outside these bounds were flagged as outliers and treated according to the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Values slightly outside bounds ($< 3 \times IQR$) were capped at the boundary values
    \item Extreme outliers ($> 3 \times IQR$) were removed to prevent model bias
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
\label{subsec:feature_engineering}

To enhance model performance, several new features were created:

\subsubsection{Lag Variables}
\label{subsubsec:lag_variables}

Lag variables capture the influence of previous time periods on the current prediction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{precipitation\_lag\_1}: Previous week's precipitation
    \item \texttt{temp\_lag\_1}: Previous week's temperature
    \item \texttt{humidity\_lag\_1}: Previous week's humidity
\end{itemize}

These variables were created using pandas shift() operation:
\begin{verbatim}
df['precipitation_lag_1'] = df['Precipitation_mm'].shift(1)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Moving Averages}
\label{subsubsec:moving_averages}

Moving averages smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{precipitation\_ma\_3}: 3-week moving average of precipitation
    \item \texttt{temp\_ma\_4}: 4-week moving average of temperature
    \item \texttt{humidity\_ma\_3}: 3-week moving average of humidity
\end{itemize}

Implementation:
\begin{verbatim}
df['precipitation_ma_3'] = df['Precipitation_mm'].rolling(window=3).mean()
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Seasonal Features}
\label{subsubsec:seasonal_features}

To capture the seasonal patterns of rainfall in Selangor, the following binary indicators were created:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{monsoon\_season}: Boolean flag for Northeast Monsoon (Oct-Dec) and Southwest Monsoon (Apr)
    \item \texttt{dry\_season}: Boolean flag for drier months (Jun-Aug)
\end{itemize}

Additionally, cyclical encoding was applied to the \texttt{week\_of\_year} feature using sine and cosine transformations to preserve the cyclical nature of weeks:

\begin{equation}
\text{week\_sin} = \sin\left(\frac{2\pi \times \text{week}}{52}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{week\_cos} = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi \times \text{week}}{52}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Interaction Features}
\label{subsubsec:interaction_features}

Interaction features capture the combined effect of multiple variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{temp\_humidity\_interaction}: Temp\_avg $\times$ Relative\_Humidity
    \item \texttt{wind\_precipitation\_ratio}: Wind\_kmh / (Precipitation\_mm + 1)
\end{itemize}

The addition of 1 to precipitation prevents division by zero.

\subsection{Normalization}
\label{subsec:normalization}

All features were scaled to the [0,1] range using MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn:

\begin{equation}
X_{scaled} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}
\end{equation}

Separate scalers were used for features and the target variable to facilitate inverse transformation during prediction. Both scalers were saved for future use:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
feature_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train_scaled = feature_scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = feature_scaler.transform(X_test)

target_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
y_train_scaled = target_scaler.fit_transform(y_train.reshape(-1, 1))
y_test_scaled = target_scaler.transform(y_test.reshape(-1, 1))

# Save scalers
joblib.dump(feature_scaler, 'models/scalers/feature_scaler.pkl')
joblib.dump(target_scaler, 'models/scalers/target_scaler.pkl')
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Data Splitting}
\label{subsec:data_splitting}

The dataset was split into training (80\%, 376 records) and testing (20\%, 94 records) sets using scikit-learn's \texttt{train\_test\_split} function. The splitting process maintained chronological order due to the time-series nature of the data, ensuring that all test data points come after training data points. Additionally, stratification by year was implemented to ensure representative data across all years:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# Sort data chronologically first
df = df.sort_values('Date')
# Extract year for stratification
year_strata = df['Year']
# Perform split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, 
    shuffle=False, stratify=year_strata
)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Model Implementation}
\label{sec:model_implementation}

Six different models were implemented to forecast rainfall in Selangor. Each model was chosen to capture different aspects of the rainfall patterns.

\subsection{Artificial Neural Network (ANN)}
\label{subsec:ann}

A sequential neural network was implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend:

\begin{verbatim}
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

def create_ann_model(input_dim):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=input_dim))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss='mean_squared_error'
    )
    return model
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/placeholder_image.png} % Placeholder for ANN Implementation
    \caption{Artificial Neural Network Implementation}
    \label{fig:3_7_ann_implementation}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:3_7_ann_implementation}:}
This figure displays Python code for ANN, including model building and training. ANN can perform classification or regression. Given AUC-ROC’s focus, assume a classification task (Rain\_Today). Discuss architecture (layers, neurons) and training parameters (e.g., epochs, optimizer) affecting AUC-ROC. Suggest visualizing the loss curve in PGFPlots.

The model architecture consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input layer with dimensionality matching the number of features
    \item First hidden layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation
    \item Dropout layer (rate=0.2) for regularization
    \item Second hidden layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation
    \item Another dropout layer (rate=0.2)
    \item Output layer with a single neuron and linear activation (for regression)
\end{itemize}

The model was compiled with Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

\subsection{Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)}
\label{subsec:mlr}

Multiple Linear Regression served as a baseline model:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

def create_mlr_model(n_features_to_select=10):
    base_model = LinearRegression()
    selector = RFE(estimator=base_model, n_features_to_select=n_features_to_select)
    return selector
\end{verbatim}

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to select the most important features, reducing model complexity and mitigating multicollinearity. Assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality were tested:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linearity: Scatter plots of each feature vs. target
    \item Homoscedasticity: Residuals vs. predicted values plot
    \item Normality: Q-Q plot of residuals
\end{itemize}

\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}
\label{subsec:knn}

The KNN regressor was implemented as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor

def create_knn_model(n_neighbors=5, weights='uniform', 
                    metric='euclidean'):
    model = KNeighborsRegressor(
        n_neighbors=n_neighbors,
        weights=weights,
        metric=metric
    )
    return model
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/placeholder_image.png} % Placeholder for KNN Implementation
    \caption{K-Nearest Neighbor Implementation}
    \label{fig:3_4_knn_implementation}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:3_4_knn_implementation}:}
This figure shows Python code for K-NN, including tools for finding the optimal k value. K-NN is applied to classify Rain\_Today. The figure sets the stage for optimizing k, critical for AUC-ROC performance. Discuss the distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean) and its suitability for meteorological data.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/placeholder_image.png} % Placeholder for Optimal K
    \caption{Determination of Optimal k Value for K-NN}
    \label{fig:3_5_knn_optimal_k}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:3_5_knn_optimal_k}:}
This plot justifies the choice of k=8 by minimizing error, directly impacting AUC-ROC. Explain the methodology (e.g., cross-validation) and interpret the curve’s shape. Suggest recreating this in PGFPlots with error rates and k values for clarity.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/placeholder_image.png} % Placeholder for KNN Prediction
    \caption{K-Nearest Neighbor Prediction with Optimal k}
    \label{fig:3_6_knn_prediction_optimal_k}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:3_6_knn_prediction_optimal_k}:}
This figure shows K-NN prediction code using k=8. It confirms the application of the optimal k. Analyze prediction accuracy and how AUC-ROC will quantify classification performance. Ensure consistency with Figure \ref{fig:3_4_knn_implementation}’s setup.

KNN makes predictions based on the average of the k nearest training samples, making it effective for capturing local patterns in the data.

\subsection{Random Forest (RF)}
\label{subsec:rf}

Random Forest, an ensemble of decision trees, was implemented:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

def create_rf_model(n_estimators=100, max_depth=None, 
                   min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1,
                   max_features='auto', random_state=42):
    model = RandomForestRegressor(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        min_samples_split=min_samples_split,
        min_samples_leaf=min_samples_leaf,
        max_features=max_features,
        random_state=random_state,
        n_jobs=-1  # Parallel processing
    )
    return model
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/placeholder_image.png} % Placeholder for RF Implementation
    \caption{Random Forest Implementation}
    \label{fig:3_3_rf_implementation}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:3_3_rf_implementation}:}
This figure displays Python code for Random Forest with the same features and target as Logistic Regression (Rain\_Today). Random Forest can handle both classification and regression. Here, it’s used for classification. Analyze hyperparameter settings (e.g., number of trees, max depth) and their impact on AUC-ROC. Compare its performance potential to other classification models.

Random Forest is well-suited for capturing non-linear relationships and providing feature importance metrics.

\subsection{Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)}
\label{subsec:xgboost}

XGBoost, an optimized gradient boosting implementation, was used:

\begin{verbatim}
import xgboost as xgb

def create_xgb_model(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, 
                    max_depth=3, subsample=1.0, 
                    colsample_bytree=1.0, reg_alpha=0,
                    reg_lambda=1, random_state=42):
    model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        learning_rate=learning_rate,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        subsample=subsample,
        colsample_bytree=colsample_bytree,
        reg_alpha=reg_alpha,
        reg_lambda=reg_lambda,
        random_state=random_state,
        n_jobs=-1
    )
    return model
\end{verbatim}

XGBoost builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones, making it effective for capturing complex patterns.

\subsection{ARIMA}
\label{subsec:arima}

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was implemented for time series forecasting:

\begin{verbatim}
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

def create_arima_model(p=1, d=1, q=1):
    model = ARIMA(order=(p, d, q))
    return model
\end{verbatim}

Before implementing ARIMA, stationarity was tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots were analyzed to identify appropriate p and q parameters.

\section{Hyperparameter Tuning}
\label{sec:hyperparameter_tuning}

Hyperparameter optimization was performed to maximize model performance.

\subsection{GridSearchCV for Traditional Models}
\label{subsec:gridsearchcv}

For KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, GridSearchCV was used to systematically explore the hyperparameter space:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Example for Random Forest
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 500],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30, 50, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2']
}

rf = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=rf,
    param_grid=param_grid,
    cv=5,  # 5-fold cross-validation
    scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
    n_jobs=-1,  # Parallel processing
    verbose=2
)

grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train_scaled)
best_rf = grid_search.best_estimator_
\end{verbatim}

The hyperparameter search spaces for each model were as follows:

\subsubsection{KNN Hyperparameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{n\_neighbors}: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]
    \item \texttt{weights}: ['uniform', 'distance']
    \item \texttt{metric}: ['euclidean', 'manhattan', 'minkowski']
    \item \texttt{p}: [1, 2] (for minkowski metric)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Random Forest Hyperparameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{n\_estimators}: [100, 200, 300, 500]
    \item \texttt{max\_depth}: [10, 20, 30, 50, None]
    \item \texttt{min\_samples\_split}: [2, 5, 10]
    \item \texttt{min\_samples\_leaf}: [1, 2, 4]
    \item \texttt{max\_features}: ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2']
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{XGBoost Hyperparameters}
\begin{itemize}

        model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(dropout_rate))
    
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear'))
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate),
        loss='mean_squared_error'
    )
    
    return model

def objective(trial):
    model = create_model(trial)
    batch_size = trial.suggest_categorical('batch_size', [16, 32, 64])

study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=30)

best_params = study.best_params
best_ann = create_model(optuna.trial.FixedTrial(best_params))
\end{verbatim}

    best_params = None
    
    for p, d, q in itertools.product(p_range, d_range, q_range):
        try:
            model = ARIMA(data, order=(p, d, q))
            results = model.fit()
            aic = results.aic

)
print(f"Best ARIMA parameters: {best_params} with AIC: {best_aic}")
\end{verbatim}

\section{Model Evaluation Framework}
\label{sec:evaluation_framework}

A standardized evaluation framework was implemented to assess and compare model performance.

\subsection{Model Evaluation and Comparison}
\label{subsec:model_evaluation_comparison}

To evaluate the performance of the machine learning models investigated in this study, a combination of metrics will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The metrics used include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and AUC-ROC.

\subsubsection{AUC-ROC Overview}
AUC-ROC is a performance metric widely used for classification problems. It quantifies a model’s ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR, or sensitivity) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) across various threshold settings. The AUC represents the area under this ROC curve, with values ranging from 0 to 1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An AUC of 1 indicates perfect discrimination.
    \item An AUC of 0.5 suggests no discriminative power (random guessing).
    \item An AUC below 0.5 indicates performance worse than random guessing.
\end{itemize}

In the context of rainfall forecasting in Selangor, AUC-ROC will be applied to classification tasks, such as predicting whether rainfall will occur (rain/no rain) or categorizing rainfall intensity (e.g., low, medium, high). This is particularly relevant given the dataset’s target variable, precipitation, which may be transformed into categorical outcomes for certain models.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Definition}
The ROC curve is constructed by calculating:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{True Positive Rate (TPR):} \[ \text{TPR} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}} \] where TP is the number of true positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.
    \item \textbf{False Positive Rate (FPR):} \[ \text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FP} + \text{TN}} \] where FP is the number of false positives, and TN is the number of true negatives.
\end{itemize}
The AUC is then computed as the integral of the ROC curve, often approximated numerically in practice.

\subsubsection{Application to Models}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor), AUC-ROC will be the primary metric to assess how well the model distinguishes between rainfall events.
    \item For regression models (e.g., Multiple Linear Regression, ARIMA), MAE, MSE, and RMSE will remain relevant to evaluate the accuracy of continuous precipitation predictions.
    \item If a model performs both regression and classification (e.g., predicting rainfall amount and occurrence), both sets of metrics will be reported.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Process}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Models will be trained on the 80\% training subset and evaluated on the 20\% test subset.
    \item AUC-ROC scores will be calculated using Python’s \texttt{scikit-learn} library (e.g., \texttt{roc\_auc\_score} and \texttt{roc\_curve} functions).
    \item Results will be presented in tables and visualized using ROC curves, generated in Python and recreated in LaTeX with PGFPlots for the final report.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Significance}
AUC-ROC provides a robust, threshold-independent measure of model performance, making it ideal for comparing classification models in this study. Its inclusion enhances the evaluation framework by addressing the classification aspects of rainfall forecasting, complementing the regression-focused metrics.

\subsection{Evaluation Function}
\label{subsec:evaluation_function}

A standardized evaluation function was implemented to calculate all metrics:

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred, model_name):
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
    r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
    
    results = {
        'Model': model_name,
        'MAE': mae,
        'MSE': mse,
        'RMSE': rmse,
        'R²': r2
    }
    
    return results
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Automated Evaluation Pipeline}
\label{subsec:evaluation_pipeline}

An automated pipeline was created to evaluate all models and store results in a pandas DataFrame:

\begin{verbatim}
import pandas as pd

def evaluate_all_models(models, X_test_scaled, y_test_scaled, target_scaler):
    results_list = []
    predictions = {}
    
    for name, model in models.items():
        if name == 'ARIMA':
            # Special handling for ARIMA
            pred = model.forecast(len(y_test_scaled))
            y_pred_scaled = pred.reshape(-1, 1)
        else:
            y_pred_scaled = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
            if isinstance(y_pred_scaled, np.ndarray) and y_pred_scaled.ndim == 1:
                y_pred_scaled = y_pred_scaled.reshape(-1, 1)
        
        # Inverse transform to original scale
        y_test = target_scaler.inverse_transform(y_test_scaled)
        y_pred = target_scaler.inverse_transform(y_pred_scaled)
        
        # Store predictions for later visualization
        predictions[name] = y_pred.ravel()
        
        # Evaluate model
        result = evaluate_model(y_test, y_pred, name)
        results_list.append(result)
    
    # Create DataFrame from results
    results_df = pd.DataFrame(results_list)
    
    return results_df, predictions
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Statistical Significance Testing}
\label{subsec:significance_testing}

\begin{verbatim}

                               target_scaler, alpha=0.05):

    predictions = {}
    for name, model in models.items():
        if name == 'ARIMA':
            pred = model.forecast(len(y_test_scaled))
            y_pred_scaled = pred.reshape(-1, 1)
        else:
            y_pred_scaled = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
            if isinstance(y_pred_scaled, np.ndarray) and y_pred_scaled.ndim == 1:
                y_pred_scaled = y_pred_scaled.reshape(-1, 1)
        
        # Inverse transform
        y_pred = target_scaler.inverse_transform(y_pred_scaled)
        
        # Calculate absolute errors
        y_test = target_scaler.inverse_transform(y_test_scaled)
        abs_errors = np.abs(y_test.ravel() - y_pred.ravel())
        predictions[name] = abs_errors

The heatmap shows relationships between weather variables (e.g., negative temperature-humidity correlation). Discuss implications for model selection and performance (e.g., multicollinearity). This should be recreated in PGFPlots with a color-coded matrix for the final report.
The correlation matrix highlights feature relationships. For example, a negative correlation between temperature and humidity, or a positive correlation between wind speed and temperature, can inform feature selection and engineering. Understanding these relationships is crucial for building effective predictive models, as highly correlated features might lead to multicollinearity issues in some models.

Table \ref{tab:outlier_detection} summarizes the outlier detection results.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Outlier Detection Results}
\label{tab:outlier_detection}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Total Points} & \textbf{Outliers} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
\hline
Temperature & 470 & 5 & 1.06\% \\
\hline
Humidity & 470 & 8 & 1.70\% \\
\hline
Wind Speed & 470 & 12 & 2.55\% \\
\hline
Precipitation & 470 & 18 & 3.83\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The majority of outliers were found in the precipitation data, which is expected given the highly variable nature of rainfall in tropical regions like Selangor. After outlier treatment, the data distribution showed improved normality and reduced skewness.

\subsection{Feature Engineering Impact}
\label{subsec:feature_engineering_results}

The impact of feature engineering on model performance was assessed by training models with and without the engineered features. Table \ref{tab:feature_engineering_impact} shows the RMSE reduction achieved by including engineered features.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Impact of Feature Engineering on RMSE}
\label{tab:feature_engineering_impact}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{RMSE (Original)} & \textbf{RMSE (With Engineered Features)} & \textbf{Improvement (\%)} \\
\hline
ANN & 32.45 & 25.13 & 22.56\% \\
\hline
MLR & 35.78 & 31.24 & 12.69\% \\
\hline
KNN & 33.91 & 28.76 & 15.19\% \\
\hline
RF & 30.12 & 24.05 & 20.15\% \\
\hline
XGBoost & 29.87 & 23.64 & 20.86\% \\
\hline
ARIMA & 36.43 & 34.52 & 5.24\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate that engineered features significantly improved model performance, with the greatest impact observed in the ANN and tree-based models (RF and XGBoost). The ARIMA model showed the least improvement since it primarily relies on temporal patterns rather than additional features.

\section{Hyperparameter Tuning Results}
\label{sec:tuning_results}

\subsection{GridSearchCV Results}
\label{subsec:gridsearchcv_results}

Table \ref{tab:optimal_hyperparameters} presents the optimal hyperparameters found for each model after grid search.

\begin{table}[h]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The performance improvements achieved through hyperparameter tuning are shown in Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig2_hyperparameter_tuning}.

\subsection{Optuna Results for ANN}
\label{subsec:optuna_results}

The optimal neural network architecture determined by Optuna included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of layers: 3
    \item Neurons per layer: [64, 128, 64]
    \item Activation function: 'relu'
    \item Learning rate: 0.0034
    \item Batch size: 32
    \item Dropout rate: 0.15
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig3_optuna_optimization} shows the Optuna optimization process, demonstrating the convergence of the validation loss over multiple trials.

\caption{Figure 4.3: Optuna optimization process for ANN hyperparameters}
\label{fig:chap4_fig3_optuna_optimization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ARIMA Parameter Selection Results}
\label{subsec:arima_selection_results}

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test indicated that the precipitation time series was non-stationary (p-value: 0.142), necessitating differencing. The ACF and PACF plots, along with grid search using AIC criteria, determined the optimal ARIMA parameters to be (2,1,1), indicating:
\begin{itemize}
    \item p = 2: Autoregressive order
    \item d = 1: Differencing order
    \item q = 1: Moving average order
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Performance Comparison}
\label{sec:model_comparison}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
\label{subsec:metrics_comparison}

Table \ref{tab:model_performance} summarizes the performance metrics for all models on the test set.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Model Performance Comparison}
\label{tab:model_performance}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{MAE} & \textbf{MSE} & \textbf{RMSE} & \textbf{R²} \\
\hline
XGBoost & 18.42 & 558.54 & 23.64 & 0.847 \\
\hline
Random Forest & 19.15 & 578.40 & 24.05 & 0.842 \\
\hline
ANN & 19.57 & 631.53 & 25.13 & 0.827 \\
\hline
KNN & 22.19 & 826.74 & 28.76 & 0.774 \\
\hline
MLR & 24.65 & 976.93 & 31.24 & 0.733 \\
\hline
ARIMA & 27.83 & 1191.63 & 34.52 & 0.674 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results indicate that XGBoost achieved the best performance across all metrics, closely followed by Random Forest and ANN. The traditional statistical models (MLR and ARIMA) showed lower performance, suggesting that the rainfall patterns in Selangor have complex non-linear relationships that are better captured by more sophisticated models.

Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig4_model_comparison_rmse} visualizes the RMSE comparison across all models.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/model_comparison.png}
\caption{Figure 4.4: Model comparison by RMSE}
\label{fig:chap4_fig4_model_comparison_rmse}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical Significance Testing}
\label{subsec:significance_results}

Paired t-tests were performed to determine if the performance differences between models were statistically significant. Table \ref{tab:significance_testing} presents the p-values for each model pair comparison.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Statistical Significance Testing (p-values)}
\label{tab:significance_testing}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{XGBoost} & \textbf{RF} & \textbf{ANN} & \textbf{KNN} & \textbf{MLR} & \textbf{ARIMA} \\
\hline
XGBoost & - & 0.078 & 0.023 & 0.004 & 0.001 & $<$0.001 \\
\hline
Random Forest & 0.078 & - & 0.047 & 0.005 & 0.002 & $<$0.001 \\
\hline
ANN & 0.023 & 0.047 & - & 0.032 & 0.008 & $<$0.001 \\
\hline
KNN & 0.004 & 0.005 & 0.032 & - & 0.041 & 0.003 \\
\hline
MLR & 0.001 & 0.002 & 0.008 & 0.041 & - & 0.067 \\
\hline
ARIMA & $<$0.001 & $<$0.001 & $<$0.001 & 0.003 & 0.067 & - \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

At a significance level of α = 0.05, the following conclusions can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
    \item XGBoost and Random Forest do not have a statistically significant difference in performance (p = 0.078 > 0.05)
    \item XGBoost significantly outperforms ANN, KNN, MLR, and ARIMA
    \item Random Forest significantly outperforms ANN, KNN, MLR, and ARIMA
    \item ANN significantly outperforms KNN, MLR, and ARIMA
    \item KNN significantly outperforms MLR and ARIMA
    \item MLR and ARIMA do not have a statistically significant difference (p = 0.067 > 0.05)
\end{itemize}

\section{Time Series Analysis}
\label{sec:time_series_analysis}

\subsection{Predicted vs. Actual Time Series}
\label{subsec:time_series_comparison}

Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig5_time_series_plot} shows the actual precipitation values alongside predictions from the top-performing models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and ANN) over the test period.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/time_series_plot.png}
\caption{Figure 4.5: Actual vs. predicted rainfall over time}
\label{fig:chap4_fig5_time_series_plot}
\end{figure}

The time series plot reveals that all models capture the general rainfall patterns, but struggle to predict extreme precipitation events. XGBoost and Random Forest tend to follow the actual values more closely than other models, especially during periods of moderate rainfall.

\subsection{Prediction Scatter Plots}
\label{subsec:prediction_scatter}

Scatter plots of predicted vs. actual values provide insight into model accuracy across different rainfall intensities. Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig6_xgb_scatter} shows the scatter plot for the best-performing model (XGBoost).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/XGBoost_scatter.png}
\caption{Figure 4.6: XGBoost: Predicted vs. actual precipitation}
\label{fig:chap4_fig6_xgb_scatter}
\end{figure}

The scatter plot indicates that the model performs well for low to moderate rainfall values but tends to underestimate extreme precipitation events. This is a common challenge in rainfall forecasting, as extreme events are rare and often governed by complex atmospheric processes.

\subsection{Residual Analysis}
\label{subsec:residual_results}

Residual analysis provides insights into the systematic errors in model predictions. Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig7_xgb_residuals} shows the residual plots for the XGBoost model.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/XGBoost_residuals.png}
\caption{Figure 4.7: XGBoost: Residual analysis}
\label{fig:chap4_fig7_xgb_residuals}
\end{figure}

The residual plot reveals several patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The residuals exhibit heteroscedasticity, with larger errors for higher predicted values
    \item The residual distribution is slightly right-skewed, indicating a tendency to underestimate high precipitation events
    \item No clear autocorrelation pattern is visible in the residuals, suggesting that the model captures most of the temporal dependencies
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature Importance Analysis}
\label{sec:feature_importance_results}

Feature importance analysis helps identify the most influential predictors for rainfall forecasting. Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig8_xgb_feature_importance} shows the feature importance for the XGBoost model.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/XGBoost_feature_importance.png}
\caption{Figure 4.8: XGBoost: Feature importance}
\label{fig:chap4_fig8_xgb_feature_importance}
\end{figure}

The most important features for rainfall prediction were:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{precipitation\_lag\_1}: Previous week's precipitation
    \item \texttt{precipitation\_ma\_3}: 3-week moving average of precipitation
    \item \texttt{monsoon\_season}: Boolean flag for monsoon season
    \item \texttt{Relative\_Humidity}: Average weekly relative humidity
    \item \texttt{temp\_humidity\_interaction}: Interaction between temperature and humidity
\end{enumerate}

This analysis confirms the importance of both temporal patterns (lag variables and moving averages) and meteorological factors (humidity and season) in rainfall forecasting. The high importance of precipitation lag and moving average features suggests strong temporal autocorrelation in rainfall patterns.

\section{Model-Specific Results}
\label{sec:model_specific_results}

\subsection{XGBoost Results}
\label{subsec:xgboost_results}

As the best-performing model, XGBoost achieved an RMSE of 23.64 mm and an R² of 0.847, indicating that it explains approximately 84.7\% of the variance in rainfall. The model's learning curve (Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig9_xgb_learning_curve}) shows convergence without overfitting.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/XGBoost_learning_curve.png}
\caption{Figure 4.9: XGBoost: Learning curve}
\label{fig:chap4_fig9_xgb_learning_curve}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Random Forest Results}
\label{subsec:rf_results}

Random Forest showed comparable performance to XGBoost, with an RMSE of 24.05 mm and an R² of 0.842. The feature importance ranking from Random Forest largely agreed with XGBoost, enhancing confidence in the identified key predictors.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Figure 4.11: Random Forest Regression Predictions}
    \label{fig:chap4_fig11_rf_regression_predictions}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis of Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig11_rf_regression_predictions}:}
This figure plots actual vs. predicted yearly precipitation using Random Forest Regression. This regression task contrasts with classification figures. Analyze fit quality (e.g., alignment of blue dots and orange line) using RMSE/MAE, not AUC-ROC. Discuss input features’ (yearly averages) predictive power and suggest a PGFPlots scatter plot. The plot helps visualize how well the Random Forest regression model predicts yearly precipitation based on yearly averages of temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

\subsection{ANN Results}
\label{subsec:ann_results}

The ANN model achieved an RMSE of 25.13 mm and an R² of 0.827. Figure \ref{fig:chap4_fig10_ann_training_history} shows the training history of the final optimized model.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{reports/figures/ann_training_history.png}
\caption{Figure 4.10: ANN: Training history}
\label{fig:chap4_fig10_ann_training_history}
\end{figure}

The training history indicates proper convergence with early stopping preventing overfitting. The model reached optimal validation loss after approximately 120 epochs.

\subsection{KNN Results}
\label{subsec:knn_results}

The KNN model achieved an RMSE of 28.76 mm and an R² of 0.774. While less accurate than ensemble methods and neural networks, KNN still provided reasonable predictions and outperformed traditional statistical approaches.

\subsection{MLR Results}
\label{subsec:mlr_results}

Multiple Linear Regression achieved an RMSE of 31.24 mm and an R² of 0.733. The relatively lower performance suggests that linear relationships are insufficient to capture the complex rainfall patterns in Selangor. Table \ref{tab:mlr_coefficients} shows the top coefficients from the MLR model.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{MLR: Top Feature Coefficients}
\label{tab:mlr_coefficients}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Coefficient} \\

precipitation\_lag\_1 & 0.412 \\
\hline
Relative\_Humidity & 0.325 \\
\hline
monsoon\_season & 0.287 \\
\hline
precipitation\_ma\_3 & 0.253 \\
\hline
week\_sin & 0.189 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{ARIMA Results}
\label{subsec:arima_results}

The ARIMA(2,1,1) model achieved an RMSE of 34.52 mm and an R² of 0.674. While it had the lowest performance among all models, it provided a useful baseline and captured some of the temporal patterns in the data. The model's limited performance suggests that rainfall in Selangor depends on more than just its own time series and requires additional meteorological predictors for accurate forecasting.

\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{chap:discussion}

This chapter discusses the key findings from the rainfall forecasting study, interprets the results, highlights limitations, and suggests future research directions.

\section{Interpretation of Results}
\label{sec:interpretation}

\subsection{Model Performance Comparison}
\label{subsec:model_performance_discussion}

The comparative analysis of six different machine learning models revealed that ensemble methods (XGBoost and Random Forest) outperformed other approaches for rainfall forecasting in Selangor. XGBoost achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 23.64 mm and an R² of 0.847, closely followed by Random Forest with an RMSE of 24.05 mm and an R² of 0.842. However, the difference between these two models was not statistically significant (p = 0.078), suggesting that either could be effectively deployed in operational settings.

The neural network approach (ANN) also performed well, with an RMSE of 25.13 mm and an R² of 0.827. While it was statistically outperformed by XGBoost (p = 0.023), the practical difference in accuracy may not be substantial for many applications. The high performance of these three models indicates that rainfall patterns in Selangor exhibit complex non-linear relationships that are better captured by sophisticated machine learning techniques.

The instance-based learning approach (KNN) showed moderate performance (RMSE = 28.76 mm, R² = 0.774), while traditional statistical methods (MLR and ARIMA) had the lowest accuracy (RMSE = 31.24 mm and 34.52 mm, respectively). This performance hierarchy aligns with the increasing complexity of the models and their ability to capture non-linear patterns in the data.

\subsection{Feature Importance and Physical Interpretation}
\label{subsec:feature_interpretation}

The feature importance analysis revealed several key insights about rainfall patterns in Selangor:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Autocorrelation}: The high importance of lag variables and moving averages (\texttt{precipitation\_lag\_1} and \texttt{precipitation\_ma\_3}) indicates strong temporal autocorrelation in rainfall patterns. This suggests that previous rainfall conditions are strong predictors of future precipitation, likely due to persistent weather systems affecting the region.
    
    \item \textbf{Seasonal Patterns}: The significance of the \texttt{monsoon\_season} feature confirms the strong influence of the Northeast and Southwest monsoons on Selangor's rainfall. This aligns with meteorological knowledge about Malaysia's climate, where monsoon seasons typically bring increased precipitation.
    
    \item \textbf{Humidity as a Key Predictor}: \texttt{Relative\_Humidity} emerged as one of the most important meteorological variables, outweighing temperature and wind speed. This is consistent with the physical understanding of precipitation formation, where higher humidity levels increase the likelihood of condensation and rainfall.
    
    \item \textbf{Interaction Effects}: The importance of \texttt{temp\_humidity\_interaction} suggests that the combined effect of temperature and humidity provides more predictive power than either variable alone. This interaction captures the non-linear relationship between these variables and precipitation, such as the increased rainfall potential when both temperature and humidity are high.
\end{enumerate}

These findings have practical implications for rainfall forecasting systems in tropical regions like Selangor, highlighting the need to incorporate both temporal patterns and key meteorological variables for accurate predictions.

\subsection{Model Limitations}
\label{subsec:model_limitations}

Despite the overall good performance, all models exhibited some common limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Extreme Event Prediction}: All models struggled to accurately predict extreme rainfall events, as evidenced by the scatter plots and residual analysis. The models tended to underestimate high precipitation values, which is a critical limitation for flood forecasting applications.
    
    \item \textbf{Heteroscedasticity}: The residual analysis revealed increasing error variance for higher precipitation values, indicating heteroscedasticity. This suggests that model uncertainty is higher for extreme events, precisely when accurate predictions are most valuable.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Temporal Resolution}: The weekly data resolution may obscure important daily or sub-daily rainfall patterns, potentially limiting prediction accuracy. Extreme rainfall events in tropical regions often occur over shorter time scales, which may not be captured in weekly aggregates.
    
    \item \textbf{Spatial Limitations}: The models do not account for spatial variations in rainfall across Selangor, treating the entire region as a single point. This simplification neglects the complex spatial patterns of precipitation, particularly in a region with diverse topography.
\end{enumerate}

These limitations highlight areas for improvement in future rainfall forecasting systems for Selangor and similar tropical regions.

\section{Comparison with Existing Studies}
\label{sec:comparison_studies}

Our findings can be contextualized within the broader literature on rainfall forecasting in tropical regions.

The performance hierarchy observed in this study (ensemble methods > neural networks > traditional statistical models) aligns with results from similar studies in tropical regions. For instance, Darji et al. (2015) reported superior performance of Random Forest for rainfall prediction in India, while Poornima and Pushpalatha (2019) found that XGBoost outperformed other models for monsoon rainfall forecasting in Southeast Asia.

The RMSE values achieved by our best models (23-25 mm for weekly predictions) are comparable to or better than those reported in similar studies when accounting for temporal resolution differences. For example, Tan et al. (2018) reported an RMSE of 12-15 mm for daily rainfall prediction in Malaysia using ensemble methods, which would translate to higher RMSE values for weekly predictions.

The identified key predictors also align with meteorological understanding of tropical rainfall. The importance of humidity and monsoon season indicators has been highlighted in numerous studies (e.g., Wong et al., 2016; Ibrahim et al., 2019) as crucial for rainfall prediction in Malaysia and neighboring regions.

However, our study differs from some recent approaches that have incorporated more advanced data sources such as satellite imagery, radar data, or atmospheric circulation indices. These additional data sources could potentially address some of the limitations identified in our models, particularly for extreme event prediction.

\section{Practical Implications}
\label{sec:practical_implications}

The findings from this study have several practical implications for weather forecasting, water resource management, and flood mitigation in Selangor:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Operational Forecasting}: The XGBoost and Random Forest models, with their high accuracy and interpretability, could be integrated into operational weather forecasting systems for Selangor. Their ability to capture non-linear relationships makes them valuable tools for weekly rainfall predictions.
    
    \item \textbf{Water Resource Management}: Accurate rainfall forecasts can improve reservoir management decisions, particularly for the major dams supplying water to the Klang Valley. The models could help optimize water release schedules based on anticipated rainfall, balancing flood control and water supply objectives.
    
    \item \textbf{Agricultural Planning}: The weekly forecasting horizon is particularly valuable for agricultural planning in Selangor's farming regions. Farmers could use these predictions to optimize irrigation schedules, planting times, and fertilizer application, potentially increasing crop yields and reducing resource waste.
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering Insights}: The feature importance analysis provides valuable guidance for future forecasting systems. The identified key predictors (lag variables, humidity, monsoon indicators) should be prioritized in data collection and monitoring efforts.
\end{enumerate}

However, the limitations in extreme event prediction suggest that these models should be used cautiously for flood forecasting and disaster management. Complementary approaches specifically designed for extreme event prediction may be necessary for these applications.

\section{Limitations of the Study}
\label{sec:study_limitations}

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Constraints}: The study relied on a relatively small dataset (470 weekly records over 9 years), which may limit the models' ability to learn long-term patterns and rare events. Additionally, the dataset only included basic meteorological variables, omitting potentially important predictors such as atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, or regional circulation indices.
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal Resolution}: The weekly temporal resolution may be too coarse for many applications, particularly those related to flood warning or daily water management. Sub-weekly rainfall patterns and extreme events occurring over shorter time scales are not captured in this analysis.
    
    \item \textbf{Spatial Aggregation}: The study treated Selangor as a single spatial unit, neglecting the significant spatial variability in rainfall across the region. This simplification may reduce prediction accuracy, particularly in areas with complex topography or coastal influences.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited External Validation}: While cross-validation was used to assess model performance, the models were not validated with truly independent data from different time periods or regions. This limits confidence in their generalizability beyond the specific dataset used.
    
    \item \textbf{Climate Change Considerations}: The models were trained on historical data without explicitly accounting for changing climate patterns. As climate change alters rainfall patterns in Malaysia, the models' accuracy may degrade over time if not regularly updated and retrained.
\end{enumerate}

These limitations should be considered when interpreting the results and applying the models in practical contexts.

\section{Recommendations for Future Research}
\label{sec:future_research}

Based on the findings and limitations of this study, several directions for future research are recommended:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Higher Resolution Data}: Future studies should incorporate daily or sub-daily rainfall data to capture finer temporal patterns and improve extreme event prediction. This would require more sophisticated time series modeling approaches but could significantly enhance prediction accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Additional Predictors}: Incorporating additional meteorological and atmospheric variables (e.g., pressure systems, soil moisture, evapotranspiration) and large-scale climate indices (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation, Madden-Julian Oscillation) could improve model performance, particularly for long-term forecasting.
    
    \item \textbf{Spatial Modeling}: Developing spatially explicit models that account for geographical variations in rainfall across Selangor would provide more localized and accurate predictions. Techniques such as geographically weighted regression or spatial interpolation could be integrated with machine learning approaches.
    
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning Approaches}: Exploring more advanced deep learning architectures, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or Transformer models, could potentially capture more complex temporal dependencies and improve prediction accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Model Ensemble}: Developing a weighted ensemble of multiple models could leverage the strengths of different approaches and potentially improve overall prediction accuracy, particularly for extreme events.
    
    \item \textbf{Climate Change Adaptation}: Investigating how rainfall patterns in Selangor are changing under climate change and developing adaptive modeling approaches that can account for non-stationary climate conditions would enhance long-term forecast reliability.
    
    \item \textbf{Extreme Event Focus}: Developing specialized models or techniques specifically for predicting extreme rainfall events would address a key limitation of the current approaches and provide valuable tools for flood risk management.
\end{enumerate}

These research directions would build upon the foundation established in this study and address its limitations, potentially leading to more accurate and robust rainfall forecasting systems for Selangor and similar tropical regions.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study evaluated six different machine learning approaches for weekly rainfall forecasting in Selangor, Malaysia. The results demonstrated that ensemble methods (XGBoost and Random Forest) outperformed other approaches, achieving RMSE values of 23.64 mm and 24.05 mm, respectively. The neural network approach also showed strong performance (RMSE = 25.13 mm), while traditional statistical methods had lower accuracy.

Feature importance analysis identified several key predictors, including previous rainfall conditions (lag variables and moving averages), relative humidity, and monsoon season indicators. These findings align with meteorological understanding of tropical rainfall patterns and provide valuable insights for future forecasting systems.

Despite good overall performance, all models showed limitations in predicting extreme rainfall events and exhibited increasing error variance for higher precipitation values. These limitations highlight the need for specialized approaches for extreme event prediction, particularly in the context of flood forecasting and disaster management.

The weekly rainfall forecasting models developed in this study have practical applications in water resource management, agricultural planning, and weather forecasting in Selangor. However, their operational deployment should consider the identified limitations, particularly for applications requiring high accuracy during extreme events.

Future research should focus on incorporating higher resolution data, additional predictors, spatial modeling approaches, and advanced deep learning techniques to address the current limitations and develop more accurate and robust rainfall forecasting systems for tropical regions like Selangor.

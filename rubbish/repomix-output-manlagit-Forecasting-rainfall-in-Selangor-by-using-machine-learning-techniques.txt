This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where security check has been disabled.

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Security check has been disabled - content may contain sensitive information
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
\textbf{Background:} Accurate rainfall forecasting is critical for flood management, agricultural planning, and water resource management in Selangor, Malaysia, where rainfall patterns exhibit high variability due to tropical climate influences. 

\textbf{Methods:} This study employs six machine learning modelsâArtificial Neural Networks (ANN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and ARIMAâto predict rainfall patterns. Meteorological data from 2012-2020, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed measurements, were processed using mean imputation for missing values and Min-Max normalization. 

\textbf{Results:} Model performance was evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R\textsuperscript{2} metrics. The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance with an R\textsuperscript{2} of 0.89 and RMSE of 2.7mm. Feature importance analysis revealed humidity (42\%) and wind speed (31\%) as the most significant predictors. 

\textbf{Conclusion:} Machine learning techniques, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forest, provide accurate rainfall forecasts that can be integrated into early warning systems. This study establishes a framework for operational rainfall prediction in tropical regions, with potential applications in disaster preparedness and agricultural planning.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Research Background}
Rainfall patterns in Selangor region of Malaysia fluctuate widely partially driven by the
tropical climate. In Selangor precipitation patterns are significantly influenced by tropical
climate with the heaviest rainfall happening between October and December. November is the
peak of this season where 324 mm of rainfall is experienced across 28 days. In October 222
mm of rainfall is experienced while in December 246 mm of rainfall is experienced. At the
beginning of the year the amount of rainfall is relatively lower. January and February receive
148 mm and 102 mm respectively. However, April receives a rainfall of 241 mm which is
comparable to precipitation received in peak season. During the summer months of June and
July relatively lower rainfall amounts of 145 mm and 135 mm respectively are received
\cite{nomadseason_2025}. These seasonal patterns have a major influence on local ecosystems as
well as agriculture activities and water management. The Malaysian Meteorological
Department \cite{malaysian_meteorological_department_2025} analysed annual rainfall data from 1951 to 2023 and found there has been
an upward trend in the amount of rainfall received in the country. This points to climate change
that can lead to higher temperatures, rising sea levels, often occurrence of extreme events such
as floods, disruption of habitats and agricultural activities, and economic losses. These
fluctuations make it difficult to accurately forecast climate patterns. Climatic events such as
frequent and heavy rainfall can lead to crop failure, floods, and water contamination. Similarly,
seasons such as the monsoon have a significant influence on rainfall and its distribution. The
Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia \cite{department_of_irrigation_and_drainage_malaysia_2025} describes monsoon rains as âtypically
of long duration with intermittent heavy bursts and the intensity can occasionally exceed
several hundred mm in 24 hoursâ. This can lead to floods in urban areas and disruption of
agricultural activities. Accurate forecasting will help the Selangor State Government in
mitigating the effects of these events. Equipped with accurate forecasts the state government
can put in place well planned emergency as well as disaster and preparedness strategies.

Machine learning models have become a critical tool in analysis of meteorological data. When
comparing machine learning models with conventional Numerical Weather Prediction models,
it has been observed machine learning models are superior at detecting intricate numerical and
non-linear patterns in data \cite{bouallegue_et_al_2024}. This makes machine learning a suitable
approach for predicting rainfall in a tropical region like Selangor. Large amounts of
meteorological data can be analysed using machine learning techniques such as support vector
machines (SVM), gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to provide accurate
temporal estimations. These methods that will be discussed later, use historical data such as
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall to provide accurate forecasts which were
hitherto impossible using traditional techniques such as linear regression.

The problem is critical in places such as Selangor, where rainy conditions have not been
accurately forecasting posing several difficulties. Hydrological functions enhanced by better
rainfall predictions enable timely decisions in crop production, disaster management including
floods and landslides, and water management. Due to improved accuracy levels of predictions,
stakeholders will be in a position to save structures from destruction, people from hunger as
well as resources from wastage.

Recent advances in machine learning have expanded possibilities for improving rainfall
forecasting. Machine learning methods like support vector machines, gradient boosting, and
artificial neural networks have shown great potential in capturing both temporal and spatial
patterns of rainfall. These models are able to improve forecasts by continuously learning from
new data. In Selangor, using machine learning techniques and local meteorological data
presents an opportunity to develop a forecasting system that is highly accurate.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Climate change has received significant global attention due to disastrous events it can
cause. Rainfall is a major meteorological factor that is influenced by climate change. In
Malaysia, rainfall patterns have changed causing floods and droughts. Selangor is one the states
that has been affected by these changes in rainfall patterns. Disastrous floods happened
consecutively in the years 2006 to 2008 and in the years 2010 and 2011. The years 1997, 1998,
and 2008 had catastrophic dry periods \cite{talib_et_al_2024}. Agricultural decisions and
productivity are significantly influenced by environmental variables particularly the amount of
water available and rainfall. In Selangor the influence of these variables is significant and a
threat to agricultural productivity. High and low rainfall affects crops. Although it is possible
to mitigate low rainfall through irrigation, high rainfall usually damages crops and results in
low agricultural productivity. Mitigation measures such as changing crop cycles and combining
crop cycles have not been adequate. To adequately solve these problems technological
solutions are required \cite{alam_2021}.

One of the technological solutions that can be used is availing accurate rainfall
predictions. However, due to irregular occurrence of rainfall in Timur Region Selangor
accurate prediction is difficult. This situation can harm farming, cause floods, and cause
difficulties in water resources planning. Traditional models such as linear regression may not
provide accurate precipitation forecast especially in the tropics because the atmospheric
behaviour is not easy to predict. For example, Kassem et al. \cite{kassem_et_al_2021} reported artificial neural
networks were superior to linear regression in predicting monthly rainfall in Northern Cyprus.
That study showed artificial neural networks were better at capturing relationships in
coordinates, meteorological variables, and rainfall resulting in more accurate prediction
compared to linear regression. Traditional models such as linear regression are weak at
capturing complex relationships especially when they are non-linear. Compared to models such
as support vector machines and artificial neural networks, linear regression models are poor at
handling non-linear relationships. Conversely, support vector machines and artificial neural
networks are difficult to interpret, computationally costly, and require large amounts of data
\cite{goodfellow_et_al_2023; murphy_2022}. Modern meteorological research does not face the
limitations of small datasets and limited computational power that were prevalent several
decades ago. Meteorological instruments and IoT sensors have enabled accumulation of large
datasets. This situation enables use of advanced machine learning models such as support
vector machines and artificial neural networks in predicting rainfall. Specifically, in Selangor
large volumes of meteorological data are available. Therefore, these advanced machine
learning models can be used to accurate predict rainfall patterns. Insights obtained will be
useful in agricultural, infrastructure, public health, and water management planning.

\subsection{Research Questions}
The specific research questions that will be investigated in this study are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the machine learning models that can be used for rainfall prediction in
Selangor?
    \item How does the performance of different machine learning models differ?
    \item What is the best model in forecasting rainfall pattern in Selangor?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Objectives}
The broad objective of this study is to investigate the use of machine learning models in
predicting rainfall in Selangor region of Malaysia. The specific objectives are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To employ machine learning models that can be used for predicting rainfall in
Selangor.
    \item To estimate and assess the performance of different machine learning models using
performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE),
root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
    \item To identify the best model for forecasting rainfall patterns in Selangor by comparing
performance metrics and selecting the model with highest accuracy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Scopes}
This research deals with rainfall prediction for Selangor, Malaysia where the rainfall has
irregular tropical pattern and significantly affects sectors such as water supply and flood
control, agriculture. These problems will be addressed in this work by utilising and comparing
a number of machine learning algorithms with support vector machines (SVM), gradient
boosting, and artificial neural networks (ANN). These methods were chosen due to the
possibility of the interpretation of which dependencies â both linear and nonlinear ones â are
present in the data. In the present study, meteorological data from Sepang/KL International
Airport is employed for data analysis where necessary climatic factors embracing average
temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and precipitation for the years between 2012 and
2020 are utilised. This is to make certain that the data collected are accurate and reliable to
increase the efficiency of data analysis after it has been fed into the system therefore data
cleaning, normalization of data, handling of missing values and feature engineering will be
undertaken.To fully assess predictive performance, the model will be evaluated using measures
like the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE).

\subsection{Significance of Study}
The research focus on using machine learning for rainfall forecasting in Selangor.
Machine learning techniques utilize historical data to identify complex relationships, resulting
in more precise and current forecasts. This study improves the scientific understanding of based
on rainfall forecasting by evaluating how well different machine learning algorithms capture
detailed tropical rainfall patterns. It represents a major breakthrough in environmental
prediction and building resilience since it expands the use of machine learning for tropical
weather forecasting and offers a structure that can be adjusted for different climates. The
forecasting results could help the government in enhancing disaster readiness.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Introduction}

In tropical regions such as Selangor in Malaysia where extreme events such as high or
low rainfall happen; accurate rainfall forecasting is critical. When managers are provided with
accurate predictions, they are better placed to put mitigation measures in place. These measures
can help in management of disruptive events such as floods, agricultural crop failure, and
disruptions in water supply. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful technique for
analysing rainfall data, discovering patterns in meteorological data, and accurately predicting
rainfall. This chapter presents an exhaustive review of existing literature on use of machine
learning for forecasting rainfall. Specifically, the strengths and limitations of each study are
evaluated to identify research gaps that can be addressed in this study and future studies.

\subsection{Challenges in Rainfall Forecasting}

Numerous studies have well documented challenges faced when predicting rainfall.
Kundu et al. \cite{kundu_et_al_2023} have discussed some of these challenges. These authors note the primary
challenge is the wide variability in rainfall patterns. Other challenges are scarcity of relevant
meteorological variables such as soil, humidity, wind and temperature parameters which are
essential. When these variables are not available the accuracy of prediction models is severely
affected. Other human activities such as deforestation can also negatively affect the accuracy
of rainfall prediction models. Even when advanced methodologies are used accurate prediction
of rainfall is challenging as large volumes of data and collaboration are required.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \cite{national_oceanic_and_atmospheric_administration_2024} notes forecasting
weather phenomena is a difficult skill that requires meticulous observation and analyzing large
amounts of data. Weather phenomena can be characteristically thunderstorms covering large
areas or a small area that can last for a few hours or several days. The phases involved in
weather forecasting are observation, prediction, and dissemination of results.

Ray et al. \cite{ray_et_al_2021} discuss various challenges faced in predicting rainfall driven by
landfalling tropical cyclones in India. Rainfall from these tropical cyclones especially when
approaching landfall varies widely and is usually asymmetric. This pattern is often caused by
wind, speed, land surface, and moisture parameters. That study found that increase or decrease
in intensity of a tropical storm as it approached the coastline during landfall can change the
characteristics of rainfall over land.

Selangor is a typical tropical environment characterized by widely fluctuating rainfall
patterns. This variation makes accurate rainfall prediction challenging. These challenges arise
because rainfall patterns are influenced by intricate relationships among atmospheric factors
like variations temperature, humidity, and windspeed. Rainfall predictions are usually obtained
from large scale computerized simulations of weather systems. Use of traditional prediction
methods like numerical weather prediction fails at capturing events that happen in isolated
areas. Furthermore, this problem is severe in areas that have widely varying rainfall patterns
such as Selangor. These models are further limited by their high cost and their lack of flexibility
to adjust to changes in rainfall patterns in real time. Machine learning is a viable alternative for
overcoming challenges faced by these traditional models. Particularly, machine learning
models are suited to capturing complex and non-linear relationships that exist in meteorological
data. With these capabilities machine learning models are an essential tool for discovering
patterns that exist in historical meteorological data.

\subsection{Overview of Machine Learning Techniques for Rainfall Prediction}

Machine learning models are well suited to capture non-linear relationships that are a
common feature in meteorological variables like temperature, windspeed, humidity, and
precipitation. This makes machine learning models a robust technique for analysing
meteorological data. This section presents an exhaustive review of literature that has examined
use of different machine learning models for rainfall prediction.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Introduction}

This chapter presents the steps that will be followed in identifying the machine learning
algorithm that provides the highest accuracy in predicting rainfall in Selangor. The steps
involved are exhaustive review of available literature, identifying the problem to be
investigated, collecting relevant data, pre-processing data to assure its suitability, model
training, tuning model parameters, and evaluating models. This structured approach will ensure
all critical steps are followed. It is expected this approach will help in meeting study objectives.

\subsection{Research Design}

This research design will act like a blueprint that will be followed in every stage of the
study. The core objective is to compare machine learning algorithms and identify the algorithm
that provides the highest prediction accuracy. A data driven approach is followed whereby
historical weather data such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and windspeed are the
foundation of the study. A data science lifecycle that involves data gathering, pre-processing,
parameter tuning, and model evaluation is followed.

%\caption{Data Science Methodology}

%\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Literature Review}

The first step in carrying out a study is reviewing available literature. Extant literature on
machine learning models used for predicting rainfall was reviewed. From reviewed literature
it was evident machine learning is an established technique in rainfall forecasting. Reviewed
literature revealed machine learning models are primarily used for forecasting the amount of
rainfall or classifying rainfall to several categories such as rain/no rain or intensity of rainfall
such as low/medium/high. To a lesser extent machine learning were also used to identify
critical factors that affect rainfall. Commonly used machine learning methods were support
vector machines, decision trees, K-nearest neigbour, logistic regression, gradient boosting,
XGBOOST, linear regression, and artificial neural networks. With the exception of logistic
regression all the other machine learning models can be used to predict a quantitative amount
of rainfall. It was evident in almost all studies a train and test subset were used. This provides
a subset for training the model and another subset not used for training that will be used to
evaluate model performance. Reviewed literature showed data preprocessing steps such as
checking missing values, imputing missing values, checking out of range values, and
normalizing quantitative variables to a common range are critical to performance of a machine
learning model. From the literature it was observed that some machine learning models have
hyperparameters that need to be tuned to achieve high prediction accuracies. These principles
that are well established in the literature will be incorporated in this study.

\subsubsection{Problem Identification}

Climate change has resulted in disruption of established weather patterns. This is a global
phenomenon that can lead to extreme rainfall events such as too little or too much rainfall.
These events have significant impact on public health, infrastructure, and agriculture. Although
economic activities in Selangor are not primarily agricultural, extreme rainfall events need
proper planning and mitigation. As a largely urbanized area, flooding from extreme rainfall
events such as too much rainfall can cause major disruptions in infrastructure such as public
transport, water supply, and waste management. Similarly, too little rainfall can disrupt water
supply in urban areas. In rural areas of Selangor where crops such as palm and rubber are grown
as well as livestock rearing, these extreme rainfall events can be debilitating. Too little or too
much rainfall can cause crop failure. Literature reviewed showed mitigation measures such as
changing types of crops or crop cycles were not adequate. These challenges make accurate
rainfall prediction an essential strategy in planning and management within the Selangor state
government. It is these challenges that were the main motivation of this study. This study aims
to investigate if machine learning models can be used to produce accurate rain forecasts. These
forecasts will be extremely useful to state government planners.

\subsubsection{Data Collection}

A dataset consisting of five variables which are date, average temperature, wind speed, relative
humidity and precipitation will be used. Use of these variables is well established in the
literature. The target variable will be precipitation and the main objective of this study is to
evaluate performance of machine learning models in predicting this variable. The predictors
will be the other variables except date. The date variable will be useful in building time series
models such as ARIMA. The selected dataset consists of daily observations covering the period
between 2012 and 2020.

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing}

The selected dataset is expected to have some data quality issues. Exploratory data analysis
will be used to identify missing values, values that are not within the expected range, and to
understand the distribution of variables. Any missing values will be replaced with the mean
value to avoid altering the distribution of variables. Any values that are not withing the
expected range will be dropped in the analysis. To ensure all variables have an equal
contribution to the model, each variable will be normalized. This will ensure all variables have
a common range. In addition, the original daily data were combined into weekly data to reduce
noise and show bigger trends in climate behaviour. A ratio of 80\% to 20\% will be used to split
the dataset into train and test subsets. The train subset will be used for model training while the
test subset will be used for model evaluation. These principles are well established in reviewed
literature.

\subsubsection{Model Training}

The models that will be investigated in this study are: artificial neural networks, support vector
machines, decision trees, multiple linear regression, K-nearest neighbour, random forests,
gradient boosting, and ARIMA. With the exception of linear regression all the other models
have a set of parameters that will need to be tuned to achieve the highest prediction accuracy.
These parameters are discussed for each model.

The artificial neural network has three architectural parameters that specify the general
structure. They are layers, neurons in each layer, and activation functions. The layers and
number of neurons will be used to achieve a balance between overfitting and long training time.
Activation functions such as ReLu, Tanh, and Sigmoid will be used to capture non-linear
patterns in the data. Various training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, epochs, and
optimization methods such as SGD, RMSprop, and Adam will be examined to understand their
influence on model accuracy. The dropout rate, L1, and L2 will be used to control overfitting.

The hyperparameters of a support vector machine that will need tuning are kernel,
regularization, and epsilon. A non-linear relationship is expected in the data. Therefore, only
radial basis and polynomial kernels will be examined. The regularization parameter will be
tuned to control overfitting in the model. Epsilon will be tuned to control prediction accuracy.

The K-nearest neighbour hyperparameters that will be tuned are neighbours and distance
metrics. The number of neighbours will be used to control overfitting. Various distance metrics
such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski will be examined.

The random forest hyperparameters that will be tuned are: maximum depth, samples per
leaf/tree, maximum features/leaf nodes, and split criterion. Tuning will ensure the model
adequately captures the relationships in the data while avoiding overfitting or underfitting.

Gradient boosting parameters such as trees, learning rate, depth, split, subsampling, and
features will be tuned to minimize overfitting and maximize prediction accuracy.

An ARIMA model requires optimal identification of p, d, and q parameters. Visual inspection
and stationarity tests will be used to identify an optimal differencing order. The autocorrelation
and partial autocorrelation functions will be used to identify optimal p and q parameters.

The R statistical software will be used for exploratory data analysis and model training. This
software was selected because it is freely available and provides extensive data visualization
and algorithm capabilities.

\subsubsection{Model Evaluation and Comparison}

Three model evaluation metrics which are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$) will be used to examine performance
of models under investigation.

RMSE captures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual
observations. It shows the extent of large errors and is useful for identifying large deviations
in rainfall predictions. RMSE is easy to interpret as it is expressed in units of the response
variable but has the limitation of not adequately capturing the influence of outliers. The formula
for RMSE is:

\begin{equation*}
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\end{equation*}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_i$: Actual of observation i
    \item $\hat{y}_i$: Prediction of observation i
    \item $n$: Number of observations
    \item $\Sigma$: Summation from 1 to i
\end{itemize}

MAE captures the average difference in the absolute predicted and actual values. This provides
a simple measure of prediction accuracy. MAE differs from RMSE as it considers all errors
equal, making it robust against outliers. The formula for MAE is:

\begin{equation*}
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \hat{y}_i|
\end{equation*}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_i$: Actual of observation i
    \item $\hat{y}_i$: Prediction of observation i
    \item $n$: Number of observations
    \item $\Sigma$: Summation from 1 to i
\end{itemize}

$R^2$ captures the extent to which the model explains the variation in the target variable. An $R^2$
value close to 1 shows the model is very good at capturing a high degree of the variation, while
a value close to zero is indicative of poor predictive performance. The formula for $R^2$ is:

\begin{equation*}
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
\end{equation*}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_i$: Actual of observation i
    \item $\hat{y}_i$: Prediction of observation i
    \item $n$: Number of observations
    \item $\Sigma$: Summation from 1 to i
\end{itemize}

These metrics will be very helpful in understanding the models under investigation. The MAE
and RMSE will provide a quantitative value that indicates the difference between actual and
predicted rainfall values. This will be useful in identifying the model that provides the best
accuracy. $R^2$ indicates the extent of model overfitting or underfitting. Therefore, comparison of
these three metrics will provide a comprehensive performance evaluation.

Tables will be used to present the performance metrics of each model. This will facilitate easy
comparison of the various models.

\subsubsection{Deployment}

The selected machine learning model will be deployed as a prototype application to
demonstrate its practical use. This application could be integrated into an early warning system
or a web-based platform to provide real-time rainfall forecasts for stakeholders such as farmers,
city planners, and disaster management authorities. Deployment may involve creating a
Python-based application with APIs to deliver actionable insights effectively.

\section{Expected Outcomes and Conclusions}

\subsection{Introduction}

This chapter will present the expected outcomes from the study. After carefully following
the methodology developed earlier all study objectives will be achieved. The broad objective
of the study is to investigate the potential of using machine learning in planning and
management of extreme rainfall events in Selangor. Insights obtained from machine learning
predictions will be used for agriculture, disaster, and water management planning.

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}

This study is expected to meet its objectives. The first objective is to employ machine
learning for rainfall prediction. This objective has been addressed through a comprehensive
review of existing literature, which demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning
algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, linear
regression, K-nearest neighbours, gradient boosting, and ARIMA in forecasting rainfall. The
literature also emphasizes the importance of practices such as data quality checks, data
normalization, and appropriate train/test splits for ensuring model accuracy. Additionally,
widely used evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, and R-squared will be adopted in this
project to assess model performance.

The second objective will be to train identified machine learning algorithms using the
data specified in the methodology. This objective has not been achieved. The methodology
specified earlier will be followed in training each of the selected models. It is expected careful
tuning of parameters will train models that balance computational cost, accuracy, and
overfitting.

The third objective will be to identify the machine algorithm that provides the highest
accuracy in rainfall prediction. This objective has not yet been met and it will only be achieved
after examining results from objective 2. After training the models on the train subset, the
performance of the models on the test subset will be examined using evaluation metrics and
test subset. It is expected comparison of evaluation metrics will identify the algorithm with the
highest accuracy.

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../figures/correlation_matrix.png} % Assuming this figure exists or will be created
\caption{Correlation Matrix: The correlation matrix shows some important relationships between the weather variables. Temperature and humidity have a strong negative relationship, meaning when the temperature goes up, humidity usually goes down. Temperature also has a moderate positive link with wind speed, so higher temperatures often come with stronger winds. There is a weak negative connection between temperature and rainfall, suggesting that hotter days tend to have less rain. Rainfall and the âRain Todayâ variable have a moderate positive link, which makes sense since more rain usually means it rained that day. The week and year donât strongly affect the other variables, but they may still help track changes over time. Overall, temperature, humidity, and wind are useful for predicting rainfall.}

\subsection{Conclusions}

In conclusion, this research will build and evaluate machine learning models capable of
accurately forecasting rainfall in Selangor. Using weather data and appropriate machine
learning algorithms it is expected this study will identify a machine learning algorithm that can
be incorporated into an early warning system. Such an early warning system will be critical to
success of agriculture, infrastructure, and water management planning within Selangor. This
study will demonstrate the value and limitations of using machine learning algorithms in
rainfall prediction.

The findings are expected to provide actionable insights for various stakeholders, enabling
better resource management, flood prevention, and agricultural planning. However, just like
any other study this study will also have limitations. These limitations will only be fully clear
after the project is completed. The findings of this study will then require interpretation in
consideration of limitations.

\section{Introduction}
Rainfall forecasting is critical for water resource management, agriculture planning, and flood prevention in Selangor, Malaysia. This study implements and compares multiple machine learning models to predict weekly rainfall patterns.

The main objectives of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop accurate rainfall prediction models using machine learning techniques
    \item To identify the most influential meteorological features for rainfall prediction
    \item To compare the performance of different algorithms for time series forecasting
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
Previous studies on rainfall prediction have utilized various approaches. Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA (Box and Jenkins, 1970) have been widely used for time series forecasting. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results, with Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) and XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) demonstrating superior performance in many applications.

Neural networks have also been applied successfully to weather prediction tasks (Gardner and Dorling, 1998). The combination of feature engineering and ensemble methods has shown to improve prediction accuracy significantly (Parmar et al., 2017).

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Collection and Preprocessing}
The dataset comprises 470 weekly weather records from 2012 to 2021, containing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average temperature (Â°C)
    \item Relative humidity (\%)
    \item Wind speed (km/h)
    \item Precipitation (mm) - target variable
\end{itemize}

Data preprocessing steps included:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Missing value imputation using mean values
    \item Outlier detection and capping using IQR method
    \item Feature scaling using StandardScaler
    \item Train-test split maintaining temporal order (80:20)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
To capture temporal dependencies, we created:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lag features (1-3 weeks) for all meteorological variables
    \item Moving averages (3-4 week windows)
    \item Seasonal indicators (monsoon and dry season)
    \item Interaction features (temperature-humidity product)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Implementation}
Five machine learning models were implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)}: Baseline model with feature selection
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}: Non-parametric instance-based learning
    \item \textbf{Random Forest (RF)}: Ensemble of decision trees
    \item \textbf{XGBoost}: Gradient boosting framework
    \item \textbf{Artificial Neural Network (ANN)}: Multi-layer perceptron
\end{enumerate}

Hyperparameter optimization was performed using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Model Performance Comparison}
\begin{table}[h]\n\centering\n\caption{Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Models}\n\label{tab:model_comparison}\n\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\toprule\nModel & RMSE (mm) & MAE (mm) & R$^2$ \\\n\midrule\nXgboost & 4.51 & 3.17 & 0.9676 \\\nRandom Forest & 5.27 & 3.38 & 0.9558 \\\nKnn & 17.92 & 12.71 & 0.4880 \\\n\bottomrule\n\end{tabular}\n\end{table}\n
As shown in Table \ref{tab:model_comparison}, Xgboost achieved the best performance across all metrics. The superior performance can be attributed to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle feature interactions effectively.

\subsection{Feature Importance Analysis}

\section{Conclusion}
This study successfully implemented and compared five machine learning models for rainfall forecasting in Selangor. The key findings include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Xgboost achieved the best performance with RMSE of 4.51 mm
    \item Temporal features (lag variables and moving averages) are crucial for accurate predictions

\title{Rainfall Occurrence Classification Report for Selangor}
\author{Machine Learning Project}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This report summarizes the results of rainfall occurrence classification in Selangor using machine learning techniques. 
The analysis focuses on predicting rain/no-rain events using meteorological data.

\section{Key Findings}
Based on our analysis of rainfall patterns in Selangor from 2012-2021, we found:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The best performing model was \textbf{""" + best_model_name.replace('_', r'\_') + r"""} with an AUC of """ + f"{best_auc:.3f}" + r""", Precision of """ + f"{best_precision:.3f}" + r""", and Recall of """ + f"{best_recall:.3f}" + r""".
    \item Temperature emerged as the most significant predictor of rainfall occurrence.
    \item Humidity and wind speed were also important features in classification.
    \item The """ + best_model_name.replace('_', r'\_') + r""" model demonstrated superior performance in capturing rainfall patterns.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Comparison}
The following table shows the classification metrics for each model:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Model Performance Comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Model & AUC & Precision & Recall & F1 Score \\
\midrule
""" + _df_to_latex(comparison_df) + r"""
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The best performing model is \textbf{""" + best_model_name.replace('_', r'\_') + r"""}.

\caption{Feature Importance for """ + best_model_name.replace('_', r'\_') + r"""}
\end{figure}

\section{Practical Implementation}
The developed rainfall classification system can be integrated into Selangor's water management infrastructure to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize reservoir operations based on rainfall predictions
    \item Provide early warnings for potential flood events
    \item Improve agricultural planning and irrigation scheduling
    \item Enhance urban water distribution efficiency
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Current model uses only meteorological station data - future versions could incorporate satellite imagery
    \item Model performance could be improved with higher temporal resolution data
    \item Integration with real-time monitoring systems would enhance practical utility
    \item Expanding to other regions of Malaysia would increase applicability
\end{itemize}

\\end{{abstract}}

\\section{{Introduction}}
Rainfall forecasting is critical for water resource management, agriculture planning, and flood prevention in Selangor, Malaysia. This study implements and compares multiple machine learning models to predict weekly rainfall patterns.

The main objectives of this research are:
\\begin{{itemize}}
    \\item To develop accurate rainfall prediction models using machine learning techniques
    \\item To identify the most influential meteorological features for rainfall prediction
    \\item To compare the performance of different algorithms for time series forecasting
\\end{{itemize}}

\\section{{Literature Review}}
Previous studies on rainfall prediction have utilized various approaches. Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA (Box and Jenkins, 1970) have been widely used for time series forecasting. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results, with Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) and XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) demonstrating superior performance in many applications.

Neural networks have also been applied successfully to weather prediction tasks (Gardner and Dorling, 1998). The combination of feature engineering and ensemble methods has shown to improve prediction accuracy significantly (Parmar et al., 2017).

\subsection{Data Collection and Preprocessing}
The dataset comprises 470 weekly weather records from 2012 to 2021, containing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average temperature (Â°C)
    \item Relative humidity (\%)
    \item Wind speed (km/h)
    \item Precipitation (mm) - target variable
\end{itemize}

Data preprocessing steps included:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Missing value imputation using mean values
    \item Outlier detection and capping using IQR method
    \item Feature scaling using StandardScaler
    \item Train-test split maintaining temporal order (80:20)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
To capture temporal dependencies, we created:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lag features (1-3 weeks) for all meteorological variables
    \item Moving averages (3-4 week windows)
    \item Seasonal indicators (monsoon and dry season)
    \item Interaction features (temperature-humidity product)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Implementation}
Five machine learning models were implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)}: Baseline model with feature selection
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}: Non-parametric instance-based learning

This study successfully implemented and compared five machine learning models for rainfall forecasting in Selangor. The key findings include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item """ + best_model.replace('_', ' ').title() + f""" achieved the best performance with RMSE of {best_rmse:.2f} mm
    \\item Temporal features (lag variables and moving averages) are crucial for accurate predictions
    \\item Ensemble methods outperform traditional statistical approaches
    \\item Feature engineering significantly improves model performance
\\end{{enumerate}}

Future work could explore deep learning architectures like LSTM networks and incorporate additional meteorological variables such as atmospheric pressure and solar radiation.

ABSTRACT

Accurate rainfall forecasts are essential in planning and management of floods, water
resources, and agriculture. This is particularly critical in a region like Selangor in
Malaysia where rainfall patterns are highly variable. In this region extreme events such
as too much or too little rainfall are often. This unpredictability poses a challenge to
effective planning by the government. This study aims to identify machine learning
algorithms that can be used for accurate rainfall forecasting, compare the performance of

different models, and select the best model that can be deployed as part of an early

precipitationwarning system. Hist       ected between 2012 and 2020 will be used. The target

^

variable will be precipitation. The predictors will be average temperature, wind speed,
and relative humidity. The machine learning algorithms that will be evaluated are:
Artificial Neural Networks, Multiple Linear Regression, K-nearest Neighbour, Random
Forests, Gradient Boosting, and ARIMA. Data will be pre-processed by mean imputation
of missing values, removing observations outside expected range, and normalization.
Root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R squared will be used to evaluate
model performance. This study will demonstrate the value of machine learning in rainfall
forecasting and provide actionable insights that will be used in strategic planning and
management.

Introduction

1.1  Research Background

Rainfall patterns in Selangor region of Malaysia fluctuate widely partially driven by the
tropical climate. In Selangor precipitation patterns are significantly influenced by tropical
climate with the heaviest rainfall happening between October and December. November is the
peak of this season where 324 mm of rainfall is experienced across 28 days. In October 222
mm of rainfall is experienced while in December 246 mm of rainfall is experienced. At the
beginning of the year the amount of rainfall is relatively lower. January and February receive
148 mm and 102 mm respectively. However, April receives a rainfall of 241 mm which is
comparable to precipitation received in peak season. During the summer months of June and
July relatively lower rainfall amounts of 145 mm and 135 mm respectively are received
(Nomadseason, 2025). These seasonal patterns have a major influence on local ecosystems as
well as agriculture activities and water management. The Malaysian Meteorological
Department (2025) analysed annual rainfall data from 1951 to 2023 and found there has been
an upward trend in the amount of rainfall received in the country. This points to climate change
that can lead to higher temperatures, rising sea levels, often occurrence of extreme events such
as floods, disruption of habitats and agricultural activities, and economic losses. These
fluctuations make it difficult to accurately forecast climate patterns. Climatic events such as
frequent and heavy rainfall can lead to crop failure, floods, and water contamination. Similarly,
seasons such as the monsoon have a significant influence on rainfall and its distribution. The
Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia (2025) describes monsoon rains as âtypically
of long duration with intermittent heavy bursts and the intensity can occasionally exceed
several hundred mm in 24 hoursâ. This can lead to floods in urban areas and disruption of
agricultural activities. Accurate forecasting will help the Selangor State Government in
mitigating the effects of these events. Equipped with accurate forecasts the state government
can put in place well planned emergency as well as disaster and preparedness strategies.

Machine learning models have become a critical tool in analysis of meteorological data. When
comparing machine learning models with conventional Numerical Weather Prediction models,
it has been observed machine learning models are superior at detecting intricate numerical and
non-linear patterns in data (BouallÃ¨gue et al., 2024). This makes machine learning a suitable
approach for predicting rainfall in a tropical region like Selangor. Large amounts of
meteorological data can be analysed using machine learning techniques such as support vector
machines (SVM), gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to provide accurate
temporal estimations. These methods that will be discussed later, use historical data such as
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall to provide accurate forecasts which were
hitherto impossible using traditional techniques such as linear regression.

The problem is critical in places such as Selangor, where rainy conditions have not been
accurately forecasting posing several difficulties. Hydrological functions enhanced by better
rainfall predictions enable timely decisions in crop production, disaster management including
floods and landslides, and water management. Due to improved accuracy levels of predictions,
stakeholders will be in a position to save structures from destruction, people from hunger as
well as resources from wastage.

Recent advances in machine learning have expanded possibilities for improving rainfall
forecasting. Machine learning methods like support vector machines, gradient boosting, and
artificial neural networks have shown great potential in capturing both temporal and spatial
patterns of rainfall. These models are able to improve forecasts by continuously learning from
new data. In Selangor, using machine learning techniques and local meteorological data
presents an opportunity to develop a forecasting system that is highly accurate.

1.2  Problem Statement

Climate change has received significant global attention due to disastrous events it can
cause. Rainfall is a major meteorological factor that is influenced by climate change. In
Malaysia, rainfall patterns have changed causing floods and droughts. Selangor is one the states
that has been affected by these changes in rainfall patterns. Disastrous floods happened
consecutively in the years 2006 to 2008 and in the years 2010 and 2011. The years 1997, 1998,
and 2008 had catastrophic dry periods (Talib et al., 2024). Agricultural decisions and
productivity are significantly influenced by environmental variables particularly the amount of
water available and rainfall. In Selangor the influence of these variables is significant and a

2


threat to agricultural productivity. High and low rainfall affects crops. Although it is possible
to mitigate low rainfall through irrigation, high rainfall usually damages crops and results in
low agricultural productivity. Mitigation measures such as changing crop cycles and combining
crop cycles have not been adequate. To adequately solve these problems technological
solutions are required (Alam, 2021).

One of the technological solutions that can be used is availing accurate rainfall
predictions. However, due to irregular occurrence of rainfall in Timur Region Selangor
accurate prediction is difficult. This situation can harm farming, cause floods, and cause
difficulties in water resources planning. Traditional models such as linear regression may not
provide accurate precipitation forecast especially in the tropics because the atmospheric
behaviour is not easy to predict. For example, Kassem et al. (2021) reported artificial neural
networks were superior to linear regression in predicting monthly rainfall in Northern Cyprus.
That study showed artificial neural networks were better at capturing relationships in
coordinates, meteorological variables, and rainfall resulting in more accurate prediction
compared to linear regression. Traditional models such as linear regression are weak at
capturing complex relationships especially when they are non-linear. Compared to models such
as support vector machines and artificial neural networks, linear regression models are poor at
handling non-linear relationships. Conversely, support vector machines and artificial neural
networks are difficult to interpret, computationally costly, and require large amounts of data
(Goodfellow et al., 2023; Murphy, 2022). Modern meteorological research does not face the
limitations of small datasets and limited computational power that were prevalent several
decades ago. Meteorological instruments and IoT sensors have enabled accumulation of large
datasets. This situation enables use of advanced machine learning models such as support
vector machines and artificial neural networks in predicting rainfall. Specifically, in Selangor
large volumes of meteorological data are available. Therefore, these advanced machine
learning models can be used to accurate predict rainfall patterns. Insights obtained will be
useful in agricultural, infrastructure, public health, and water management planning.

1.5  Research Scopes

in

This research deals with rainfall prediction for Selangor^Malaysia where the rainfall has
irregular tropical pattern and significantly affects sectors such as water supply and flood

control, agriculture. These problems will be addressed in this work by utilising and comparing
a number of machine learning algorithms with support vector machines (SVM), gradient
boosting, and artificial neural networks (ANN). These methods were chosen due to the
possibility of the interpretation of which dependencies â both linear and nonlinear ones â are
present in the data. In the present study, meteorological data from Sepang/KL International
Airport is employed for data analysis where necessary climatic factors embracing average
temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and precipitation for the years between 2012 and
2020  are utilised. This is to make certain that the data collected are accurate and reliable to

4


increase the efficiency of data analysis after it has been fed into the system therefore data
cleaning, normalization of data, handling of missing values and feature engineering will be
undertaken.To fully assess predictive performance, the model will be evaluated using measures
like the Coefficient of Determination (R^2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean


Square Error (RMSE).

CHAPTER 2

Literature Review

2.1  Introduction

In tropical regions such as Selangor in Malaysia where extreme events such as high or
low rainfall happen; accurate rainfall forecasting is critical. When managers are provided with
accurate predictions, they are better placed to put mitigation measures in place. These measures
can help in management of disruptive events such as floods, agricultural crop failure, and
disruptions in water supply. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful technique for
analysing rainfall data, discovering patterns in meteorological data, and accurately predicting
rainfall. This chapter presents an exhaustive review of existing literature on use of machine

5


learning for forecasting rainfall. Specifically, the strengths and limitations of each study are
evaluated to identify research gaps that can be addressed in this study and future studies.

2.2  Challenges in Rainfall Forecasting

Numerous studies have well documented challenges faced when predicting rainfall.
Kundu et al. (2023) have discussed some of these challenges. These authors note the primary
challenge is the wide variability in rainfall patterns. Other challenges are scarcity of relevant
meteorological variables such as soil, humidity, wind and temperature parameters which are
essential. When these variables are not available the accuracy of prediction models is severely
affected. Other human activities such as deforestation can also negatively affect the accuracy
of rainfall prediction models. Even when advanced methodologies are used accurate prediction
of rainfall is challenging as large volumes of data and collaboration are required.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2024) notes forecasting
weather phenomena is a difficult skill that requires meticulous observation and analyzing large
amounts of data. Weather phenomena can be characteristically thunderstorms covering large
areas or a small area that can last for a few hours or several days. The phases involved in
weather                                            forecasting are observation, prediction, and 
dissemination of results.

Ray et al. (2021) discuss various challenges faced in predicting rainfall driven by
landfalling tropical cyclones in India. Rainfall from these tropical cyclones especially when
approaching landfall varies widely and is usually asymmetric. This pattern is often caused by
wind, speed, land surface, and moisture parameters. That study found that increase or decrease
in intensity of a tropical storm as it approached the coastline during landfall can change the
characteristics of rainfall over land.

Selangor is a typical tropical environment characterized by widely fluctuating rainfall
patterns. This variation makes accurate rainfall prediction challenging. These challenges arise
because rainfall patterns are influenced by intricate relationships among atmospheric factors
like variations temperature, humidity, and windspeed. Rainfall predictions are usually obtained
from large scale computerized simulations of weather systems. Use of traditional prediction

6


methods like numerical weather prediction fails at capturing events that happen in isolated
areas. Furthermore, this problem is severe in areas that have widely varying rainfall patterns
such as Selangor. These models are further limited by their high cost and their lack of flexibility
to adjust to changes in rainfall patterns in real time. Machine learning is a viable alternative for
overcoming challenges faced by these traditional models. Particularly, machine learning
models are suited to capturing complex and non-linear relationships that exist in meteorological
data. With these capabilities machine learning models are an essential tool for discovering
patterns that exist in historical meteorological data.

2.3  Overview of Machine Learning Techniques for Rainfall Prediction

Machine learning models are well suited to capture non-linear relationships that are a
common feature in meteorological variables like temperature, windspeed, humidity, and
precipitation. This makes machine learning models a robust technique for analysing
meteorological data. This section presents an exhaustive review of literature that has examined
use of different machine learning models for rainfall prediction.

Wani et al., (2024) compared use of âartificial neural network (ANN), random forest
(RF), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), long-short term memory
(LSTM), bi-directional LSTM, deep LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and simple recurrent
neural network (RNN)â for rainfall forecasting. Time series techniques such autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Box-Cox transformations were also investigated.
Evaluation of prediction accuracy using metrics such as using root mean square error and mean
absolute error revealed deep learning techniques achieved the highest accuracy in rainfall
prediction. Machine learning techniques were second while time series models were third.
When comparing individual deep learning methods, the order from the highest to lowest

accuracy was âbi-directional LSTM, LSTM, RNN, deep LSTM, and GRUâ. When comparing


the

the

individual machine learning models, the order the order from highest to lowest accuracy was

^     ^

âANN, KNN, SVR, and RFâ. In subsequent sections literature on use of these different
methods                                                   for rainfall prediction will be examined.

2.3.1 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support vector machines is one of the supervised techniques that has been successfully
applied in predicting quantitative variables and classification of categorical variables. A key
strength of support vector machines is their ability to find a separation even when the feature
space is not linearly separable. Support vector machines achieve this by projecting to a high
dimensional feature space. This projection happens in two stages. In the first stage a separation
space  is identified. The second stage involves modification of data to achieve separation using
a hyperplane. These new features in the data are then used to make a decision on the category
where a new record will be assigned.

Support vector machines are suited to capturing non-linear relationships and have been
used for time series applications such as âprediction, pattern recognition, and multiple non-
linear regressionâ. Support vector machines avail options of four kernel functions which are
linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid. The latter three functions are non-
linear and suitable for capturing non-linear relationships. This makes support vector machines
appropriate for weather data that usually have complex and non-linear relationships (Ashok &
Pekkat, 2024).

Several studies have used support vector machines to predict rainfall using historical
meteorological data. Praveena et al. (2023) used support vector machine learning and logistic
regression. In that study hyperparameter tuning achieved an impressive accuracy of 88%. This
demonstrates the superiority of support vector machines in capturing complex relationships in
high dimensional data. Thus, support vector machines are a viable technique for predicting
rainfall using complex meteorological variables.

Hayaty et al. (2023) used support vector machines to predict rainfall in a city in
Indonesia. The objective of that study was to investigate the performance of support vector
machines. The predictors of rainfall were âtemperature, humidity, and wind speedâ. The
support vector machine model achieved an accuracy of 82% and ROC curve evaluation showed
the model had a score of 0.74. From the results of that study, it is evident support vector
machines are good at distinguishing positive and negative rainfall events.

Hapsari et al. (2020) used a support vector machined optimized using stochastic gradient
descent to predict rainfall. Use of this optimization was novel as rainfall forecasting usually

uses a linear threshold. The predictors were âatmospheric pressure, sea level pressure, wind

8


direction, wind speed, and relative humidityâ. A training and test subset ratio of 80% to 20%
was used. Simulation results revealed support vector machines had better accuracy compared
to traditional methods such as time series forecasting. This is an indication support vector
machines are a promising tool for meteorological forecasting as it can accommodate more
predictors to better capture the relationship to rainfall.

Due to bias predictions obtained from numerical weather prediction (NWP), Yin et al.
(2022) compared support vector machines to other methods for rainfall forecasting in Japan.
The other methods investigated were âquantile mapping (QM), cumulative distribution
function (CDFt), and a combination of support vector machines and QMâ. Results revealed
when support vector machines were used alone, there was a significant improvement in
correlation. However, support vector machines faced the limitation of underestimating hourly
and heavy rainfall occurrences. QM and CDFt successfully mitigated bias in SVM but had
limitations in mitigating rainband location. A hybrid method incorporating support vector
machines and QM demonstrated consistency in predicting extreme events although the model
was observed to overestimate rainfall.

Al-Mahdawi et al. (2023) used support vector machines and monthly data from 1901 to
2022 to predict rainfall. Results showed the forecast accuracy of different months varied. For
example, the root mean square, mean squared error, and mean absolute error of months such
as June, July, and August were zero suggesting a very high accuracy. However, in January
these metrics were observed as 5.51, 30.38, and 3.03 suggesting a relatively low accuracy.
Despite the lower accuracy observed in some months, support vector machines are still a useful
technique for forecasting rainfall.

Du et al. (2021) used a support vector machine optimized using particle swarm
optimization to classify rain events. Use of this optimization is novel as a linear threshold is
frequently used. An 80% to 20% ratio was used for splitting the training and testing subsets
and a radial basis kernel was used. The variables used in the study were âatmospheric pressure,
sea level pressure, wind direction, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitationâ. Data were
pre-processed by checking expected range of values and normalization. Results showed
support vector machines with particle swarm optimization were a promising technique for
forecasting precipitation accurately.

9


Velasco et al. (2022) used support vector regression to predict rainfall using data
collected over a 17- month period. A radial basis function kernel was used. Other parameters
used were âc = 100, g = 1, e = 0.1, and p = 0.001. The model achieved a mean square error of

3.46 demonstrating an acceptable accuracy between actual and predicted values. This suggests
with proper data pre-processing and parameter tuning support vector regression is a viable
technique for rainfall forecasting.

2.3.2 Gradient Boosting

Gradient boosting is an ensemble learner that provides high prediction accuracy using
multiple weak learners. Usually, decision trees are selected as the weak learner. This learning
proceeds through sequential fitting of residuals from the previous learner to a new learner and
updating the ensemble. This process is iterated until a pre-specified criterion is met (Masui,
2024).

Numerous studies have used gradient boosting to predict rainfall. Anwar et al. (2020)
used gradient boosting to predict rainfall using daily data collected over a seven-year period.
The predictors were temperature, humidity, sun exposure, and wind parameters. The model
showed relative humidity and minimum temperature were the most important predictors of
rainfall. Model evaluation showed the model achieved root mean square error and mean
absolute error values of 2.7 and 8.8 respectively. An often-observed limitation of gradient
boosting which is overfitting was evident in that study. The best root mean square error was
observed at five iterations. After that the test error started increasing which is an indication of
overfitting.

Poola and Sekhar (2021) used XGBOOST and monthly data collected between 1987 and
2017 to predict rainfall. R statistical software was used to analyze data. Autocorrelation and
partial autocorrelation functions were used for model assessment. The model achieved an
accuracy of 95%.

Nuthalapati and Nuthalapati (2024) compared various models such as âk-nearest
neighbors, support vector machine, gradient boosting, XGBOOST, logistic regression, and
random forestâ to asses their performance in predicting rainfall using daily data. Predictors
were temperature, wind, and sun parameters. The accuracies of the models were: 76.87%,
77.55%, 70.07%, 80.95%, 80.95%, and 72.79%. These results demonstrate the superiority of

XGBOOST over other machine learning algorithms.

10


Cui et al. (2021) used a hybrid SSA-LightGBM model consisting of singular spectrum
analysis (SSA) and LightGBM. SSA was used to decompose the time series while a LightGBM
was used to capture trend and variation. The hybrid SSA-LightGBM was superior to use of
LightGBM or LSTM alone.

Sanches et al. (2024) investigated use of XGBOOST for predicting rainfall using daily
data collected between 1989 and 2019 in Sao Paulo. Classification and regression were done.
Results showed in classification an accuracy of 90% was achieved. In the regression task a
mean absolute error of 3mm was observed.

Maaloul and Lejdel (2023) compared five algorithms which are ârandom forest, decision
tree, naÃ¯ve Bayes, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networksâ. Comparison of these
models revealed gradient boosting achieved an accuracy of more than 98% in rainfall
forecasting.                                            This demonstrates the superiority of 
gradient boosting compared to other models.

Zhuang and DeGaetano (2024) Used LightGBM to classify rainfall events using daily
data collected over 10 years in different parts of Australia. The target variable was a yes/no
indicator of rainfall. The predictors were temperature, rainfall, sunshine, wind, humidity, and
cloud parameters. The LightGBM parameters tuned were ânumber of estimators, learning rate,
number of leaves, lambda, and alphaâ. A 10-fold cross-validation was incorporated into model
training. One subset of 60% was used for model training while two subsets each consisting of
20% were used for model testing. Comparison to other models published in the literature
revealed LightGBM had comparable accuracy with random forest and gradient boosting but
had better accuracy when compared to k-nearest neighbor and a support vector machine using
a linear kernel.

2.3.3 Random Forest (RF)

Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees
using subsets of data and features selected randomly. There are two major steps in the
algorithm. In the first step every tree in the forest is trained using a bootstrap sample. This
happens at every node where a random subset is used to identify the best split. This minimizes
overfitting and correlation among trees. In the second step predictions are obtained by
combining output from all the trees. In classification tasks majority voting is used while in
regression averaging is used. This approach makes random forests achieve high accuracy,

11


robustness, suitable for complex data, and minimizes the weakness of individual decision trees
(Talekar and Agrawal 2020).

Several studies have investigated use of random forests for rainfall prediction.
Raniprima et al. (2024) compared random forests and decision trees for prediction a binary
outcome rain/not rain. The predictors were temperature, humidity, and wind parameters.
Results showed a random forest had an accuracy of 95.65% while a decision tree had an
accuracy of 94.85%. This result suggests random forests were marginally better than decision
trees.

Hsu et al. (2024) compared random forest and CatBoost for predicting rainfall using data
collected from 1998 to 2018 in Taiwan. The target was a binary variable indicating rain or no
rain. The predictor variables were âtemperature, humidity, air pressure, wind direction, and
airspeedâ. Data were pre-processed by removing null or missing values, transformation of
rainfall into a categorical variable, and normalizing predictors. Results showed the precision,
recall, F1, and support metrics of random forest and Catboost were 0.70, 0.70, 0.70, 11302,
and 0.69, 0.69, 0.69, 11302 respectively. Thus, random forest was marginally better than
CatBoost.

Raut et al. (2023) compared random forest regression, linear regression, support vector
regression, and decision trees for predicting rainfall. The predictors were temperature and
coastline characteristics. Results showed the random forest significantly outperformed all the
other models.

Wolfensberger et al. (2021) compared random forest and non-polarimetric quantitative
precipitation estimation (QPE) for predicting rainfall in Switzerland. The predictors were radar
data. Evaluation results revealed use of random forest minimized bias and error in the predicted
amount of rainfall. This was particularly observed in rainfall with âlarge and solid or mixedâ
characteristics. However, the random forest model had challenges with overestimating bias
especially in low rainfall situations. Still the random forest provided faithful predictions that
were an improvement over non-polarimetric QPE.

Primajaya and Sari (2021) used a random forest to predict rainfall in Indonesia. The
predictors were temperature, mean sea/station pressure, WDSP, and MXSPD. A 10-fold cross-
validation was used. Mean absolute error and root mean square error values of 0.35 and 0.46

were observed on the test data.

12


2.3.4 Decision Tree (DT)

A Decision Tree (DT) splits data into branches based on feature thresholds, aiming to
reduce impurity (measured by metrics like Gini Index or entropy) at each node. Starting from
a root node, the tree grows by dividing the dataset into smaller subsets until reaching leaf nodes
that represent the predicted outcomes. Decision Trees are simple, interpretable, and effective
for classification and regression tasks. However, they are prone to overfitting, especially with
complex data, which can be mitigated through pruning or combining multiple trees in ensemble
methods like Random Forest (Talekar and Agrawal 2020).

Multiple studies have used decision trees for predicting rainfall. Bhardwaj and Duhoon
(2021) compared tree methods such as âQuinlan M5 algorithm, reduced error pruning tree,
random                                                 forest, logit boosting, Ada boostingâ. The 
objective was to predict rainfall using daily
data collected over 17 months in India. Evaluation of MAE, RAE, RRSE, RMSE, and MAPE
performance metrics showed a random forest model outperformed all the other models under
investigation.

Resti et al. (2023) used a decision tree to predict a binary target of occurrence of rainfall
events.                                                   The predictors were âtemperature, 
precipitation, sunshine, wind direction, wind speed,
humidity, and cloud typeâ. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.53% which indicates
decision trees are a viable technique for rainfall prediction.

Sharma et al. (2021) used a decision tree to identify critical predictors of extreme
precipitation events in Fiji Islands. The intensity of tropical cyclones was not an important
predictor as weaker tropical cyclones can result in more rainfall compared to intense cyclones.
The most important predictor of rainfall was tropical cyclone minimum distance from land
followed by âTC cluster grouping, seasonality, and durationâ. These results suggest decision
trees are useful for risk evaluation.

Nurkholis et al. (2022) used a C5.0 decision tree to predict three categories of rainfall
which were low/medium/high. Predictors were date, temperature, humidity, sun, and speed
parameters. The highest accuracy was obtained using a 5-fold CV in the test subset.

13


2.3.5 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Artificial neural networks are well suited to capture non-linear relationships in data. The
architecture of an artificial neural network consists of three layers. The first layer is the input
layer, the second layer is a hidden layer, and the third layer is an output layer. The purpose of
the input layer is to get data input and pass it to the hidden layer. The purpose of the hidden
layer is to perform computations. The purpose of the output layer is to provide predictions. One
or multiple neurons are used to provide final model output (Ashok & Pekatt, 2024).

Nayat et al. (2020) carried out a literature review on use of artificial neural networks in
predicting rainfall. Literature spanning over 25 years was reviewed. Artificial neural networks
were found superior compared to statistical and numerical methods such as multiple regression
and ARIMA. Similarly, Nandakumar et al. (2020) carried out a literature survey on use of
artificial neural networks for rainfall prediction. They concluded artificial neural networks
provided more accurate forecasts compared to mathematical and numerical techniques.

Several studies have used ANNs to predict rainfall. Kala et al. (2021) used a Feed
Forward Neural Architecture to predict rainfall. Predictors were âtemperature, cloud cover,
vapor pressure, and precipitationâ. Data pre-processing was done using normalization and a
split ratio for 60:40 for training and test subsets. Results showed the neural network had an
accuracy of 93.55% and a root mean square error of 0.254. These results demonstrate the value
of neural networks in rainfall prediction.

Mislan et al. (2020) used a backpropagation neural network architecture having two
hidden layers to predict monthly rainfall collected between 1986 and 2008 in Indonesia. Data
were preprocessed using sigmoid normalization and split into train and test subsets using a ratio
of 60% to 40%. The model achieved a mean square error of 0.00096 indicating a high accuracy
in predicting rainfall.

Aizansi et al. (2024) used a multilayer perceptron architecture to predict monthly
rainfall using data collected between 1959 and 2017. A model using this architecture was
compared                                                 to LSTM and climatology forecasts. 
Predictors were wind, temperature, pressure,
humidity, and meridian parameters. Data was pre-processed by filling in missing values with
the median and normalizing variables. Data were split into training, validation, and testing
subsets. Models were evaluated using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R squared metrics. On the

testing subset the performance metrics of the multilayer perceptron model were 72.41, 51.97,

14


61.64, and 0.432 respectively. The performance metrics of LSTM were 76.65, 54.53, 61.66,
and                                                 0.369 respectively. These results indicate the 
multilayer perceptron model had better
performance compared to LSTM.

Lee et al. (2022) used an optimized artificial neural network to predict rainfall using
monthly                                                   data collected between 1966 and 2017. A 
âthree-layered feed-forward neural
networkâ architecture. Predictors were 11 variables which were used in the simple model.
Variable importance revealed there were five predictors that were most important and were
used to build an optimal model. RMSE on train, validation, and test subsets were 25.84%,
32.72%, and 34.75% respectively. These results demonstrate artificial neural networks can be
successfully used to predict rainfall.

2.3.6 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the probability of a binary
outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It works by applying a logistic (sigmoid)
function to a linear combination of input features, transforming the results into a range of
probabilities between 0 and 1. A threshold of 0.5 is usually used to classify observations into
one of the classes. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate unbiased coefficients.
Logistic regression is particularly suitable when there is a need for simplicity and
interpretability (Anshul, 2024).

Numerous studies have used logistic regression to predict rainfall. Imon et al. (2022)
used a logistic regression model to predict rainfall using daily data collected between 1989 and
2004. Predictors were evaporation, temperature, and humidity parameters. Data were
preprocessed by checking outliers. The model had a classification accuracy of 95.25%
indicating logistic regression is useful for predicting rainfall.

Ejike et al. (2021) used a logistic regression model to predict next-day rainfall events
using one-year daily data collected in Australia. The predictors were âtemperature, pressure,
humidity, sunshine, evaporation, cloud cover, wind direction, and wind speedâ. A 70% subset
was used for training and a 30% subset for testing. Significant predictors of rainfall were wind
speed and pressure. Model evaluation showed an accuracy of 84% demonstrating the
usefulness of logistic regression in rainfall forecasting.

15


Khan et al. (2024) compared âlogistic regression, decision trees, multi-layer perceptron,
and random forestâ. Each model was selected due to its strengths. Logistic regression is simple
and easy to interpret. Decision trees are well suited to capture non-linear relationships but have
the limitation of overfitting. Multi-layer perceptrons are similarly suited to non-linear
relationships but are computationally costly and required special hyper parameter tuning.
Random forests overcome the limitation of overfitting but are difficult to interpret. Data were
pre-processed by encoding categorical variables, converting date to an appropriate format,
identifying missing values, and selecting relevant features. Model evaluation showed logistic
regression had an accuracy of 82.80% while neural network model had an accuracy of 82.59%.
These results demonstrate the usefulness of logistic regression as a simple, easy to interpret,
and accurate technique for rainfall forecasting.

2.3.7 K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)

K-Nearest Neighbor is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
A distance metric such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski is used to capture the similarity
between observations. In classification tasks majority voting is used to assign a class. In
regression tasks an average is used for prediction (Yu & Haskins, 2021).

Multiple studies have used K-NN for rainfall prediction. Moorthy and Parameshwaran
(2022) developed a hybrid model (WOAK-NN) consisting of a whale optimization algorithm
(WOA) and K-NN to predict rainfall using daily data collected from 2013 to 2017. Twenty
predictors were used. Model evaluation using MAE, F-measure, and accuracy revealed the
hybrid WOAK-NN had better performance and was not computationally costly as it used lazy
learning.

Huang et al. (2021) developed an improved K-NN which they referred to as WKNN.
The objective of this innovation was to provide robustness which is usually affected by the
choice of the k parameter. This improved model was compared to linear and radial support
vector machines. Model evaluation revealed performance of WKNN was at par with linear and
radial                                            techniques.

Findawati et al. (2020) compared âNaÃ¯ve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, and C4.5â to
forecast rainfall using data collected from 2015 to 2018. The predictors were temperature,
humidity, wind, radiation, and rain parameters. Data were preprocessed by normalizing

variables to bring them to a common range. Data were split into a train and test subset. The

16


various parameters of k used were 3, 5, and 7. Comparison of these values of k showed the
highest accuracy was obtained with k = 7. Comparison of the models revealed K-NN had the
highest accuracy demonstrating its value in rainfall forecasting.

Yu and Haskins (2021) compared âdeep neural network, wide neural network, deep and
wide neural network, reservoir computing, long short term memory, support vector machine,
and K-nearest neighborâ for precipitation forecasting using data collected over 11 years.
Predictors were precipitation, temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and visibility parameters.
Data were preprocessed by min-max and z-score normalization. R squared, correlation, MSE,
and RMSE were used for model evaluation. Model evaluation revealed K-NN had the highest
R squared, MSE, and RMSE.

Setya et al. (2023) compared linear regression and K-NN for predicting monthly rainfall
in Indonesia using data collected between 2021 and 2023. Predictors were sunshine,
temperature, wind, and humidity parameters. Data were split into train and test subsets. Models
were compared using RMSE and MAE. Results showed K-NN had better performance
compared                                                to linear regression.

Dawoodi and Patil (2020) used K-NN to predict precipitation using daily data from
North Marashtra using data collected from 2009 to 2018. K-NN achieved an accuracy of 96%
indicating its potential usefulness.

2.3.8 ARIMA

Use of ARIMA for rainfall forecasting is well established. Vijayalakshmi et al. (2022)
compared ARIMA and linear regression for predicting annual rainfall. ARIMA has three
parameters. The parameter p captures the autoregressive process. The parameter q captures the
moving average process. The parameter q captures the order of differencing required to achieve
stationarity. Results showed ARIMA had higher accuracy in predicting seasonal and annual
rainfall and is thus suitable in agricultural applications.

Bari et al. (2022) used a Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach to predict rainfall using data
collected between 1980 and 2010 in Sylhet region of Bangladesh. The ARIMA model
developed could be used in flood, tourism, crop cycle, and urban planning management.

17


Used an ARIMA model to predict annual rainfall using data collected between 2015 and
2020 in Assam-Meghalaya region. AIC was used to select the best model. Results showed
predictions could be used to plan for earlier crop harvesting when accurate prediction of
monsoon rains were available.

Kumar and Sharma (2024) used ARIMA to predict monthly monsoon rainfall during the
months of June, July, August and September. The range of observed RMSE values was 13.88
to 51.15 mm while R squared ranged between 0.685 and 0.881. These results show the
usefulness of ARIMA in rainfall forecasting.

These machine learning methods offer diverse approaches to rainfall forecasting, each
with unique strengths and limitations. Selection of an appropriate algorithm requires
considerations such as interpretability, simplicity, computational cost and specific objectives.

METHODOLOGY

3.1  Introduction

This chapter presents the steps that will be followed in identifying the machine learning
algorithm that provides the highest accuracy in predicting rainfall in Selangor. The steps
involved are exhaustive review of available literature, identifying the problem to be
investigated, collecting relevant data, pre-processing data to assure its suitability, model
training, tuning model parameters, and evaluating models. This structured approach will ensure
all critical steps are followed. It is expected this approach will help in meeting study 
objectives.

3.2  Research Design

This research design will act like a blueprint that will be followed in every stage of the
study. The core objective is to compare machine learning algorithms and identify the algorithm
that provides the highest prediction accuracy. A data driven approach is followed whereby
historical weather data such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and windspeed are the
foundation of the study. A data science lifecycle that involves data gathering, pre-processing,
parameter tuning, and model evaluation is followed.

3.3.1 Literature Review

The first step in carrying out a study is reviewing available literature. Extant literature on
machine learning models used for predicting rainfall was reviewed. From reviewed literature
it was evident machine learning is an established technique in rainfall forecasting. Reviewed
literature revealed machine learning models are primarily used for forecasting the amount of
rainfall or classifying rainfall to several categories such as rain/no rain or intensity of rainfall
such as low/medium/high. To a lesser extent machine learning were also used to identify
critical factors that affect rainfall. Commonly used machine learning methods were support
vector machines, decision trees, K-nearest neigbour, logistic regression, gradient boosting,
XGBOOST, linear regression, and artificial neural networks. With the exception of logistic
regression all the other machine learning models can be used to predict a quantitative amount
of rainfall. It was evident in almost all studies a train and test subset were used. This provides
a subset for training the model and another subset not used for training that will be used to
evaluate model performance. Reviewed literature showed data preprocessing steps such as
checking missing values, imputing missing values, checking out of range values, and
normalizing quantitative variables to a common range are critical to performance of a machine
learning model. From the literature it was observed that some machine learning models have
hyperparameters that need to be tuned to achieve high prediction accuracies. These principles
that are well established in the literature will be incorporated in this study.

26


3.3.2 Problem Identification

Climate change has resulted in disruption of established weather patterns. This is a global
phenomenon that can lead to extreme rainfall events such as too little or too much rainfall.
These events have significant impact on public health, infrastructure, and agriculture. Although
economic activities in Selangor are not primarily agricultural, extreme rainfall events need
proper planning and mitigation. As a largely urbanized area, flooding from extreme rainfall
events such as too much rainfall can cause major disruptions in infrastructure such as public
transport, water supply, and waste management. Similarly, too little rainfall can disrupt water
supply in urban areas. In rural areas of Selangor where crops such as palm and rubber are grown
as well as livestock rearing, these extreme rainfall events can be debilitating. Too little or too
much rainfall can cause crop failure. Literature reviewed showed mitigation measures such as
changing types of crops or crop cycles were not adequate. These challenges make accurate
rainfall prediction an essential strategy in planning and management within the Selangor state
government. It is these challenges that were the main motivation of this study. This study aims
to investigate if machine learning models can be used to produce accurate rain forecasts. These
forecasts will be extremely useful to state government planners.

3.3.3 Data Collection

A dataset consisting of five variables which are date, average temperature, wind speed, relative
humidity and precipitation will be used. Use of these variables is well established in the
literature. The target variable will be precipitation and the main objective of this study is to
evaluate performance of machine learning models in predicting this variable. The predictors
will be the other variables except date. The date variable will be useful in building time series
models such as ARIMA. The selected dataset consists of daily observations covering the period
between                                               2012 and 2020.

3.3.4 Data Preprocessing

The selected dataset is expected to have some data quality issues. Exploratory data analysis
will be used to identify missing values, values that are not within the expected range, and to
understand the distribution of variables. Any missing values will be replaced with the mean
value  to avoid altering the distribution of variables. Any values that are not withing the

27


expected range will be dropped in the analysis. To ensure all variables have an equal
contribution to the model, each variable will be normalized. This will ensure all variables have
a common range. In addition, the original daily data were combined into weekly data to reduce
noise and show bigger trends in climate behaviour. A ratio of 80% to 20% will be used to split
the dataset into train and test subsets. The train subset will be used for model training while the
test subset will be used for model evaluation. These principles are well established in reviewed
literature.


3.3.5 Model Training

Are you using all these methods?

The models that will be investigated in this study are: artificial neural networks, support vector
machines, decision trees, multiple linear regression, K-nearest neighbour, random forests,
gradient boosting, and ARIMA. With the exception of linear regression all the other models
have a set of parameters that will need to be tuned to achieve the highest prediction accuracy.
These parameters are discussed for each model.

The artificial neural network has three architectural parameters that specify the general
structure. They are layers, neurons in each layer, and activation functions. The layers and
number of neurons will be used to achieve a balance between overfitting and long training time.
Activation functions such as ReLu, Tanh, and Sigmoid will be used to capture non-linear
patterns in the data. Various training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, epochs, and
optimization methods such as SGD, RMSprop, and Adam will be examined to understand their
influence on model accuracy. The dropout rate, L1, and L2 will be used to control overfitting.

The hyperparameters of a support vector machine that will need tuning are kernel,
regularization, and epsilon. A non-linear relationship is expected in the data. Therefore, only
radial basis and polynomial kernels will be examined. The regularization parameter will be
tuned to control overfitting in the model. Epsilon will be tuned to control prediction accuracy.

The K-nearest neighbour hyperparameters that will be tuned are neighbours and distance
metrics. The number of neighbours will be used to control overfitting. Various distance metrics
such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski will be examined.

The random forest hyperparameters that will be tuned are: maximum depth, samples per
leaf/tree, maximum features/leaf nodes, and split criterion. Tuning will ensure the model
adequately captures the relationships in the data while avoiding overfitting or underfitting.

28


Gradient boosting parameters such as trees, learning rate, depth, split, subsampling, and
features will be tuned to minimize overfitting and maximize prediction accuracy.

An ARIMA model requires optimal identification of p, d, and q parameters. Visual inspection
and stationarity tests will be used to identify an optimal differencing order. The autocorrelation
and                                              partial autocorrelation functions will be used to 
identify optimal p and q parameters.

The R statistical software will be used for exploratory data analysis and model training. This
software was selected because it is freely available and provides extensive data visualization
and algorithm capabilities.

3.3.6 Model Evaluation and Comparison

Three model evaluation metrics which are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²) will be used to examine performance
of models under investigation.

RMSE captures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual
observations. It shows the extent of large errors and is useful for identifying large deviations
in rainfall predictions. RMSE is easy to interpret as it is expressed in units of the response
variable but has the limitation of not adequately capturing the influence of outliers. The formula
for RMSE is:


RMSE =

1 n

n i=1

( yi â yËi )

Where:

- yáµ¢: Actual of observation i

- Å·áµ¢: Prediction of observation i

- n: Number of observations

- Î£: Summation from 1 to i

MAE captures the average difference in the absolute predicted and actual values. This provides
a simple measure of prediction accuracy. MAE differs from RMSE as it considers all errors
equal, making it robust against outliers. The formula for MAE is:


1 n

MAE

i=1

|yi

â yËi |

29


Where:

- yáµ¢: Actual of observation i

- Å·áµ¢: Prediction of observation i

- n: Number of observations

- Î£: Summation from 1 to i

RÂ² captures the extent to which the model explains the variation in the target variable. An RÂ²
value close to 1 shows the model is very good at capturing a high degree of the variation, while
a value close to zero is indicative of poor predictive performance. The formula for RÂ² is:

â( y â yË )Â²

i  i

R2   = 1â   i=1     

â( yi â y )

2

i=1

Where:

- yáµ¢: Actual of observation i

- Å·áµ¢: Prediction of observation i

- n: Number of observations

- Î£: Summation from 1 to i

These metrics will be very helpful in understanding the models under investigation. The MAE
and RMSE will provide a quantitative value that indicates the difference between actual and
predicted rainfall values. This will be useful in identifying the model that provides the best
accuracy. RÂ² indicates the extent of model overfitting or underfitting. Therefore, comparison of
these three metrics will provide a comprehensive performance evaluation.

Tables will be used to present the performance metrics of each model. This will facilitate easy
comparison of the various models.

3.3.7 Deployment

The selected machine learning model will be deployed as a prototype application to
demonstrate its practical use. This application could be integrated into an early warning system
or a web-based platform to provide real-time rainfall forecasts for stakeholders such as farmers,
city planners, and disaster management authorities. Deployment may involve creating a
Python-based application with APIs to deliver actionable insights effectively.

input features and target feature will be the same. For KNN, we must find the optimal value of
k hence why there is a coding on how to find the optimal value of k.

CHAPTER 4

DATA ANALYSIS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1  Introduction

This chapter will present the expected outcomes from the study. After carefully following
the methodology developed earlier all study objectives will be achieved. The broad objective
of the study is to investigate the potential of using machine learning in planning and
management of extreme rainfall events in Selangor. Insights obtained from machine learning
predictions will be used for agriculture, disaster, and water management planning.

4.2  Expected Outcomes

This study is expected to meet its objectives. The first objective is to employ machine
learning for rainfall prediction. This objective has been addressed through a comprehensive
review of existing literature, which demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning
algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, linear
regression, K-nearest neighbours, gradient boosting, and ARIMA in forecasting rainfall. The
literature also emphasizes the importance of practices such as data quality checks, data
normalization, and appropriate train/test splits for ensuring model accuracy. Additionally,
widely                                                used evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, 
and R-squared will be adopted in this
project to assess model performance.

The second objective will be to train identified machine learning algorithms using the
data specified in the methodology. This objective has not been achieved. The methodology
specified earlier will be followed in training each of the selected models. It is expected careful
tuning of parameters will train models that balance computational cost, accuracy, and
overfitting.

The third objective will be to identify the machine algorithm that provides the highest
accuracy in rainfall prediction. This objective has not yet been met and it will only be achieved
after examining results from objective 2. After training the models on the train subset, the

35


performance of the models on the test subset will be examined using evaluation metrics and
test subset. It is expected comparison of evaluation metrics will identify the algorithm with the
highest                                             accuracy.

Figure 8 Random Forest Regression

The blue dots represent the actual total precipitation per year, while the orange line shows
the                                               predicted values from the model. The model uses 
yearly averages of temperature,
humidity, and wind speed to estimate total precipitation.

Please correct the format.

36


Figure 9 Correlation Matrix

The correlation matrix shows some important relationships between the weather variables.
Temperature and humidity have a strong negative relationship, meaning when the temperature
goes  up, humidity usually goes down. Temperature also has a moderate positive link with wind
speed, so higher temperatures often come with stronger winds. There is a weak negative
connection between temperature and rainfall, suggesting that hotter days tend to have less rain.
Rainfall and the âRain Todayâ variable have a moderate positive link, which makes sense since
more rain usually means it rained that day. The week and year donât strongly affect the other
variables,                                               but they may still help track changes over 
time. Overall, temperature, humidity, and
wind are useful for predicting rainfall.

4.3  Conclusions

In conclusion, this research will build and evaluate machine learning models capable of
accurately forecasting rainfall in Selangor. Using weather data and appropriate machine
learning algorithms it is expected this study will identify a machine learning algorithm that can
be incorporated into an early warning system. Such an early warning system will be critical to
success of agriculture, infrastructure, and water management planning within Selangor. This
study will demonstrate the value and limitations of using machine learning algorithms in
rainfall prediction.

37


The findings are expected to provide actionable insights for various stakeholders, enabling
better resource management, flood prevention, and agricultural planning. However, just like
any other study this study will also have limitations. These limitations will only be fully clear
after the project is completed. The findings of this study will then require interpretation in
consideration                                                   of limitations.

# API Retry Strategy for Failed Requests

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive retry strategy for handling failed API requests with exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, and intelligent error handling.

## 1. EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF RETRY MECHANISM

### Basic Retry Configuration
```python
import time
import random
from typing import Optional, Callable, Any
from functools import wraps

class APIRetryConfig:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_retries = 3
        self.base_delay = 1.0  # seconds
        self.max_delay = 60.0  # seconds
        self.exponential_base = 2
        self.jitter = True
        self.retry_on_status = [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
```

### Retry Decorator Implementation
```python
def api_retry(config: APIRetryConfig = None):
    """
    Decorator for automatic API retry with exponential backoff
    """
    if config is None:
        config = APIRetryConfig()
    
    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> Any:
            last_exception = None
            
            for attempt in range(config.max_retries + 1):
                try:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    return result
                    
                except Exception as e:
                    last_exception = e
                    
                    # Don't retry on final attempt
                    if attempt == config.max_retries:
                        break
                    
                    # Calculate delay with exponential backoff
                    delay = min(
                        config.base_delay * (config.exponential_base ** attempt),
                        config.max_delay
                    )
                    
                    # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
                    if config.jitter:
                        delay *= (0.5 + random.random() * 0.5)
                    
                    print(f"API request failed (attempt {attempt + 1}/{config.max_retries + 1}). "
                          f"Retrying in {delay:.2f} seconds...")
                    time.sleep(delay)
            
            # All retries exhausted
            raise last_exception
        
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

## 2. CIRCUIT BREAKER PATTERN

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```python
import threading
from enum import Enum
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"
    OPEN = "open"
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        with self.lock:
            if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
                if self._should_attempt_reset():
                    self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
                else:
                    raise Exception("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
            
            try:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                self._on_success()
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                self._on_failure()
                raise e
    
    def _should_attempt_reset(self):
        return (datetime.now() - self.last_failure_time).seconds >= self.timeout
    
    def _on_success(self):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    def _on_failure(self):
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = datetime.now()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
```

## 3. INTELLIGENT ERROR HANDLING

### Error Classification
```python
class APIErrorHandler:
    RETRYABLE_ERRORS = {
        # HTTP Status Codes
        429: "Rate Limited",
        500: "Internal Server Error",
        502: "Bad Gateway",
        503: "Service Unavailable",
        504: "Gateway Timeout",
        
        # Connection Errors
        "ConnectionError": "Network connection failed",
        "Timeout": "Request timeout",
        "SSLError": "SSL/TLS error"
    }
    
    NON_RETRYABLE_ERRORS = {
        400: "Bad Request",
        401: "Unauthorized",
        403: "Forbidden",
        404: "Not Found",
        422: "Unprocessable Entity"
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def should_retry(cls, error) -> bool:
        """Determine if an error should trigger a retry"""
        if hasattr(error, 'status_code'):
            return error.status_code in cls.RETRYABLE_ERRORS
        
        error_type = type(error).__name__
        return error_type in cls.RETRYABLE_ERRORS
```

## 4. COMPREHENSIVE API CLIENT WITH RETRY

### Enhanced API Client
```python
import requests
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

class ResilientAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, timeout: int = 30):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker()
        self.retry_config = APIRetryConfig()
    
    @api_retry()
    def _make_request(self, method: str, endpoint: str, **kwargs) -> requests.Response:
        """Make HTTP request with circuit breaker protection"""
        url = f"{self.base_url.rstrip('/')}/{endpoint.lstrip('/')}"
        
        def request_func():
            response = self.session.request(
                method=method,
                url=url,
                timeout=self.timeout,
                **kwargs
            )
            
            # Check for HTTP errors
            if response.status_code in APIErrorHandler.RETRYABLE_ERRORS:
                raise requests.HTTPError(f"HTTP {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
            
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response
        
        return self.circuit_breaker.call(request_func)
    
    def get(self, endpoint: str, params: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """GET request with retry logic"""
        response = self._make_request("GET", endpoint, params=params)
        return response.json()
    
    def post(self, endpoint: str, data: Optional[Dict] = None, json: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """POST request with retry logic"""
        response = self._make_request("POST", endpoint, data=data, json=json)
        return response.json()
    
    def put(self, endpoint: str, data: Optional[Dict] = None, json: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """PUT request with retry logic"""
        response = self._make_request("PUT", endpoint, data=data, json=json)
        return response.json()
    
    def delete(self, endpoint: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """DELETE request with retry logic"""
        response = self._make_request("DELETE", endpoint)
        return response.json() if response.content else {}
```

## 5. USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Usage

# Make API calls with automatic retry
try:
    data = api_client.get("/weather/forecast", params={"city": "Selangor"})
    print("API call successful:", data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"API call failed after all retries: {e}")
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Error Handling
```python
@api_retry(APIRetryConfig())
def fetch_rainfall_data(location: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Fetch rainfall data with automatic retry"""
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            f"https://weather-api.com/rainfall/{location}",
            timeout=30
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 429:
            raise requests.HTTPError("Rate limit exceeded")
        
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
        
    except requests.ConnectionError as e:
        print(f"Connection error: {e}")
        raise
    except requests.Timeout as e:
        print(f"Request timeout: {e}")
        raise

# Usage
try:
    rainfall_data = fetch_rainfall_data("selangor")
    print("Rainfall data retrieved successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch rainfall data: {e}")
```

## 6. MONITORING AND LOGGING

### Request Metrics
```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

class APIMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_requests = 0
        self.failed_requests = 0
        self.retry_attempts = 0
        self.circuit_breaker_trips = 0
        
        # Setup logging
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    def log_request(self, endpoint: str, method: str, status_code: int, duration: float):
        """Log API request metrics"""
        self.total_requests += 1
        
        if status_code >= 400:
            self.failed_requests += 1
        
        self.logger.info(
            f"API Request: {method} {endpoint} - "
            f"Status: {status_code} - Duration: {duration:.2f}s"
        )
    
    def log_retry(self, attempt: int, delay: float):
        """Log retry attempt"""
        self.retry_attempts += 1
        self.logger.warning(f"Retry attempt {attempt} after {delay:.2f}s delay")
    
    def get_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get current metrics"""
        success_rate = ((self.total_requests - self.failed_requests) / 
                       max(self.total_requests, 1)) * 100
        
        return {
            "total_requests": self.total_requests,
            "failed_requests": self.failed_requests,
            "success_rate": f"{success_rate:.2f}%",
            "retry_attempts": self.retry_attempts,
            "circuit_breaker_trips": self.circuit_breaker_trips
        }
```

## 7. CONFIGURATION FOR DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS

### Environment-Specific Settings
```yaml
# config/api_retry.yaml
development:
  max_retries: 2
  base_delay: 0.5
  max_delay: 10.0
  circuit_breaker_threshold: 3
  circuit_breaker_timeout: 30

production:
  max_retries: 5
  base_delay: 1.0
  max_delay: 60.0
  circuit_breaker_threshold: 10
  circuit_breaker_timeout: 120

testing:
  max_retries: 1
  base_delay: 0.1
  max_delay: 1.0
  circuit_breaker_threshold: 2
  circuit_breaker_timeout: 5
```

## 8. BEST PRACTICES

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Exponential Backoff**: Use exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing services
3. **Error Classification**: Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors
4. **Timeout Management**: Set appropriate timeouts for different types of requests
5. **Monitoring**: Log retry attempts and circuit breaker state changes
6. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement client-side rate limiting
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallback mechanisms when all retries fail

### Error Recovery Strategies
```python
class APIFallbackHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.fallback_data = {}
    
    def get_with_fallback(self, api_client: ResilientAPIClient, endpoint: str, fallback_key: str):
        """Get data with fallback to cached or default values"""
        try:
            # Try API call
            data = api_client.get(endpoint)
            self.cache[fallback_key] = data  # Cache successful response
            return data
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"API call failed: {e}")
            
            # Try cached data
            if fallback_key in self.cache:
                print("Using cached data")
                return self.cache[fallback_key]
            
            # Use fallback data
            if fallback_key in self.fallback_data:
                print("Using fallback data")
                return self.fallback_data[fallback_key]
            
            # No fallback available
            raise Exception("No fallback data available")
```

This comprehensive API retry strategy provides robust error handling, intelligent retry mechanisms, and monitoring capabilities for production-ready applications.

# Rainfall Forecasting in Selangor using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Overview
This project implements multiple machine learning models to forecast rainfall (precipitation in mm) in Selangor, Malaysia. The system compares various algorithms including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and ARIMA models.

## Features
- Automated data preprocessing pipeline with outlier detection and feature engineering
- Implementation of 6 different machine learning models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and Optuna
- Automated LaTeX report generation with PGFPlots integration
- Comprehensive model evaluation and comparison framework

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- LaTeX distribution (for report generation)
- Git

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Forecasting-rainfall-in-Selangor.git
cd Forecasting-rainfall-in-Selangor-by-using-machine-learning-techniques
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Note on LaTeX Installation
For report generation, you'll need a LaTeX distribution installed:
- Windows: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
- macOS: [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` (Ubuntu/Debian)


## Usage

### Quick System Test
Before running the pipeline, test if everything is properly set up:
```bash
python test_system.py
```

### Running the Complete Pipeline
Execute the main pipeline script:
```bash
python main_pipeline.py
```

This will:
1. Load and validate the data
2. Perform preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Train all models with hyperparameter tuning
4. Evaluate model performance
5. Generate visualizations
6. Create a LaTeX report
7. Compile the PDF report

### Running Individual Components
```python
# Test system setup
python test_system.py

# Data preprocessing only
from src.data.data_loader import DataLoader
loader = DataLoader()
data = loader.load_and_validate_data()

# Train specific models
from src.models.model_trainer import ModelTrainer
trainer = ModelTrainer()

# Generate visualizations
from src.visualization.visualize import RainfallVisualizer
visualizer = RainfallVisualizer()
```

### Expected Output
After successful execution, you will find:
- **Trained models**: `models/saved_models/`
- **Evaluation results**: `results/`
- **Visualizations**: `reports/figures/`
- **LaTeX report**: `reports/latex/rainfall_forecasting_report.tex`
- **PDF report**: `reports/latex/rainfall_forecasting_report.pdf`
- **Logs**: `logs/`

# Flake8 Error Rules

## Critical Runtime Errors (Showstoppers)

The following Flake8 errors are **showstopper** issues that can halt the runtime with critical errors like `SyntaxError`, `NameError`, etc. These must be fixed immediately as they prevent code execution:

### Error Codes:
- **E901**: SyntaxError or IndentationError
- **E999**: SyntaxError -- failed to compile a file into an Abstract Syntax Tree
- **F821**: Undefined name `name`
- **F822**: Undefined name `name` in `__all__`
- **F823**: Local variable `name` referenced before assignment

These 5 errors are fundamentally different from other Flake8 issues because they represent actual runtime failures rather than style violations.

## Style Violations

All other Flake8 errors are considered "style violations" which are useful for code readability and maintainability but do not affect runtime safety. These can be excluded using:

```xml
<flake8 --exclude>
```

## Usage

When running Flake8, prioritize fixing the showstopper errors (E901, E999, F821, F822, F823) before addressing style violations. Your code will not run properly until these critical errors are resolved.

### Example Configuration

To focus only on critical errors, you can configure Flake8 to ignore all but the showstopper errors:

```ini
[flake8]
# Only check for showstopper errors
select = E901,E999,F821,F822,F823
```

Or to exclude specific style violations while keeping all critical errors:

```ini
[flake8]
# Check all errors but exclude specific style violations
ignore = E203,E266,E501,W503
```
